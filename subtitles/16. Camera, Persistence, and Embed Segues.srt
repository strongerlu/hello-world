Stanford University.
斯坦福大学

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,210
Okay well, welcome to lecture 16 of Stanford CS193p,
好的，欢迎来到斯坦福 CS193p 2015 冬季课程，

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,178
winter of 2015.
第16课。

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,680
So today,
今天，

6
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,181
we're going to be talking about three major topics.
我们将要讲到三个主要的主题。

7
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:21,451
One is the camera, how to basically take a picture with
第一个是 Camera，怎么样基本的使用相机拍照

8
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:23,853
the camera or get video from the camera.
或者使用相机拍摄视频

9
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:27,823
Then persistence which is an important topic about how to
接下来是 Persistence，一个重要的话题关于

10
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,625
store stuff in the flash memory of your phone,
如何往你手机的内存中存储东西，

11
00:00:30,627 --> 00:00:33,194
and a lot of you have already kind of dived into
很多同学已经钻研了这个

12
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,796
this as part of your final project, but I'm just gonna
在他们的 Final Project 中，但是我仅仅只是

13
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,565
kind of give you a tour of the various ways that can be done.
给你们介绍一下各种完成这个话题的方法。

14
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:41,968
And then the last one is kind of an interesting segue.
最后一个话题是关于一个有趣的 Segue。

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,338
I leave it for last because it's kind of requires you to
我把这个放在最后，因为这是一种需要你们

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,408
be a little bit of a visual thinker, to see what's
有一点以一个视觉思考者的方式（Visual Thinker），来思考

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,977
happening when we do it, but it's called an embed segue,
我们在使用这个 Segue 时发生了什么，这个被叫做 Embed Segue，

18
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,546
which is where we basically take one MVC.
这个基本上就是我们拿一个 MVC，

19
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:59,284
And we embed its view into another MVC's view hierarchy
然后我们把它的 View 嵌入到另一个 MVC 的 View 中去

20
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:01,085
which is kind of fun.
挺有趣的。

21
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:04,255
So let's dive in right in to the camera.
好，让我们直接开始进入 Camera

22
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,390
The camera is accessed via this file or
Camera 可通过这个文件或者说

23
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,092
this class called UIImagePickerController.
这个被叫做 UIImagePickerController 的类来访问。

24
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,696
It is a UIViewController, sub-class actually of
它是一个 UIViewController，我认为

25
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,231
UINavigationController, I believe.
它实际上是 UINavigationController 的子类。

26
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,134
And it's very simple to use.
并且使用起来很简单

27
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:19,868
You really just configure it and
你只要配置好它然后

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,370
then you put it up modally.
把它设置成 Modally。

29
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,654
Okay?

30
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:23,937
So there's really nothing more to it than that.
真的没有其他要做的了。

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,574
We learned about how to put things up modally last time
我们学习了怎样把东西设置成 Modally，在上次

32
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:28,175
with presentViewController.
和 presentViewController 一起。

33
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:29,977
That's all you're gonna have to do.
这就是我们要做的所有的事了。

34
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,779
So, the process of using the UIImagePickerController
所以，使用 UIImagePickerController

35
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,514
to get something from the camera,
来从相机获得某些东西的过程，

36
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,849
is, you create it, and you set its delegate.
就是，你创建一个UIImagePickerController，然后设置它的委托。

37
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,285
It won't do anything without its delegate,
如果没有委托它不能做任何事，

38
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:40,819
so you have to set its delegate.
所以你需要设置它的委托。

39
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,354
Then you're gonna configure it, for you know?
然后你要配置它，比如说

40
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,356
Do you want just still images or video, or

41
00:01:44,358 --> 00:01:46,358

45
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,764
Then you just present it with presentViewController.
然你你通过 presentViewController 展示出来，

46
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:57,034
And then you're gonna respond to delegate methods that tell
接下来你将要对委托作出反映，委托告诉你

47
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:59,936
you, okay, I took a photo, here's the image data,
我拍了一张照，这是图像的数据，

48

49
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:06,342

00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:09,028
Each device.
每个设备，

51
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,713
Kinda has different hardware, although that's becoming less

52
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,815
and less true as the years go by.
越来越不对了。

53
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,617
It used to be that there were some iOS devices that didn't

54
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,918
even have a camera at all.
根本就没有相机。

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,822
But certainly there were early on iOS devices that could

56
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,559
Do still images, but couldn't do video for example.
可以拍照但是不能拍摄视频。

57
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:29,763
So as with all the hardware things, whether it's you know,
所以对于这些关于硬件的东西来说，不管是

58
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:33,599
Core Motion or any of those things we always wanna ask and
CoreMotion 或者其他的，我们总是会先问问并且

59
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,334
see what we can do first.
看看我们能干什么。

60
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:38,503
So it's very easy for the ImagePickerController it has
这件事对 ImagePickerController 是非常简单的

61
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,573
a class function called isSourceTypeAvailable
它有一个类方法叫做 isSourceTypeAvailable。

62
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:45,309
And there's three different sources for images or
对图像和视频来说，有三个来源

63
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,378
video to come into your app.
来进入你的 App

64
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,246
One is the camera, obviously.
第一个显然是相机。

65
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:51,581
Another one is the saved photos album,
第二个是保存的图片专辑（Photos Album），

66
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,916
that's essentially the camera roll.
这个其实就是 Camera Roll。

67
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,285
Right, things that they've taken with the camera.
没错，就是那些早就被相机拍下来的东西。

68
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,986
And then there's the photo library,
最后是 Photo Library，

69
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,522
which is the same thing they see in the photos app, okay.
就是跟你在图片 App 里看到的那个是一个东西。

70
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:03,224
So you can kinda pick which one of those things.
所以你可以选择一个来源

71
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,094
You wanna get your image or video from and
来获得照片或者视频。

72
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,562
they're a little bit different.
他们有一点点的不同。

73
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,764
photo library and the saved photos album
Photo Library 和保存的图片专辑（photo album）

74
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,666
are treated pretty much exactly the same, but
基本上可以当作一样来对待

75
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,367
the camera is a little bit different in how
不过相机在如何展示出方面有一点不同

76
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,703
it's presented, so we'll talk about that in a moment.
所以让我们来讲一下。

77
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:20,272
Once you know your source type then you're gonna say,
一旦你之道了来源的类型，然后你会问，

78
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:23,742
what are the available media types, image or video.
可用的媒体类型是什么？图片还是视频？

79
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,561
Or both.
或者两个都是。

80
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,379
Now it's almost not even worth checking for image anymore.
现在你根本不值得去为图片检查。

81
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,614
Because if you have a camera, it can get an image.
因为你现在的来源是相机，相机可以拍照。

82
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:32,516
So, I think it'd probably be okay if you just never even
所以，我觉得这可能是可以的，如果你从不

83
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:35,185
called this available media types for source type,
调用这个 availableMediaTypesForSourceType(Camera) 方法

84
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,953
if you're trying to get.
如果你在试图获得

85
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,489
An image, okay, because it's gonna be there.

86
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,791
But if you wanna get video, you definitely should call
不过如果你想要获得视频，你绝对应该调用

87
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:44,093
this in case someone has an older iPhone that won't,

88
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:45,194
doesn't capture video.
无法拍摄视频。

89
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:49,097
Now these two types, the kuTTypeImage and
这两个类型，kuTTypeImage 和

90
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,634
kuTTypeMovie, which are basically strings that
kuTTypeMovie，实际上就是能

91
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:56,570
specify these two media types.
区分这两个媒体类型的字符串。

92
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,839
Strangely, they come from this
奇怪的是，他们来自一个

93
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:02,009
Framework that your otherwise never gonna import which is
除了这个情况外你永远不会想导入的 Framework

94
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:04,077
the mobile core services framework.
就是 MobileCoreServices Framework。

95
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,714
So if you wanna use those two types right there or
所以如果你想使用这两个类型

96
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:12,818
two constants KUTType images and movie.
或者两个常量 KUTTypeImages 和 KUTTypeMovie


97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,886
You need to import mobile core services.
你需要导入 MobileCoreServices。

98
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,288
Okay?

99
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,689
I'm kinda lingering on this one because this is some
我讲这个讲了很久因为这是

100
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,102
people forget.
一些人经常忘记这事。

101
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,514
And they're just like what the heck?
然后他们会说一些比如 这是什么鬼错误？

102
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:21,926
Because if you search in the documentation it's kind of
因为如果你在文档中搜索,

103
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,910
hard to find.
这很难找到说

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,893
That you're supposed to do this.
你应该导入 MobileCoreServices。

105
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,697
Whatever.
不管怎么说

106
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:29,499
So I made a special slide and emphasize it there for you.
所以我做了幻灯片来强调这个事情。

107
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,368
You can obviously ask UIImagePickerController
你显然可以问 UIImagePickerController 要

108
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,103
for more detail even than this.
比这更多的细节。

109
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:36,705

110
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:40,442
You can say, is there a front camera?

111
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:41,743
Is there a rear camera?
是不是后置摄像头？

112
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:44,178
Which you might care if you have an app that's like selfie
你可能会关心这些如果你的 App

113
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,529
oriented.
可以拿来自拍。

114
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,879
It might wanna know that there's a front camera.
它可能想知道有没有前置摄像头

115
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,415
For that.
给它使用。

116
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,950
And you can also tell whether a flash is available on that
而且你也可以知道闪光灯是否是可以用的

117
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:52,168
device, etc.
在这台设备上，等等。

118
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:53,385
So there's a bunch of class functions in
所以有一大堆类方法在

119
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:54,653
UIImagePickerControllers.
UIImagePickerControllers 中。

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,556
You can find out what's going on.
你能知道发生一些什么。

121
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,991
So here's the code, typically,
这里是通常用来

122
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:02,460
to prepare to present the picker.
准备展示 picker 的代码。

123
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,462

你将会创建 picker。

124
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:06,030
You're gonna set its delegate.
你将会设置它的委托。

125
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,098
You're gonna ask if the camera is available.
你将会问它相机是否可用。

126
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,268
If it is, you're gonna set the source type to be the camera.
如课可用，你就会设置来源为相机。

127
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,704
Then you're gonna ask and see if, for example in this case,
比如在这个例子中

128
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,739
I wanna take a movie with my camera.
我想要用相机拍摄视频

129
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:21,210
So I'm gonna ask is that kuTTypeMovie available.
所以我问它 kuTTypeMovie 是否可用

130
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:25,513
Now, this line of code right there, if availableTypes as
现在，在这的这行代码，if (availableTypes as

131
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:29,283
NSArray).containsObject(kuTTypeMovie).
NSArray).containsObject(kuTTypeMovie).

132
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,584
That's kind of a weird line of code.
真是一行奇怪的代码

133
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,518
Really, it doesn't.
它真的没有

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,521
Fit into the swift world very well.
很好的融入 Swift 这个世界

135
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:36,589
You just do it.
你只要这样写就好了

136
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:41,093
I's an old Objective-C based API.
这是一个 Objective-C 写的旧 API

137
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:45,230
And kuTTypeMovie is even kind of an older kind of string
而且 kuTTypeMovie 是一种比

138
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:46,865
even than NSString.
NSString 还要古老的 String

139
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,366
And, so.
因此

140
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:50,067
We kind of have to do this old style thing.
我们会写这种老旧风格的代码

141
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:53,804
I'm sure probably somewhere they'll probably come up with
我能肯定可能某些地方以后会推出

142
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:57,441
some new API for this whole camera thing that doesn't have
新的 API 来控制这些相机，没有这些

143
00:05:57,443 --> 00:06:00,377
this old stuff, but for now you have to do that.
老旧的东西，不过现在你只能这么写

144
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,979
And then you just tell the picker the media types I want
然后你只要告诉 picker 媒体类型。

145
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:05,114
the user to be able to take is just a movie, so
我想要用户只能拍视频，所以

146
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:07,883
in this case they wouldn't be able to take a still image,
在这个列子里用户不能拍照片

147

00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:54,215
In translation, so
在转变中，

292
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:58,419
you can do the scale there to scale it up if you want to.
所以你能在那里放大它如果你想的话。

293
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,487
Let's do that, all right.
好的，让我们来试试

294
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:03,323
All right, so that is the ImagePickerController,
好的，所以这就是 ImagePickerController，

295
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:05,959
let's go ahead and go back to our tracked demo and
让我们继续，回到我们的 Trax Demo

296
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:08,494
use the ImagePickerController to make it, so
使用ImagePickerController来实现它

297
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,464
that if we have a waypoint, one of our custom waypoints
既然如此如果我们有waypoint，我们自定义waypoint的其中一个

298
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,932
that we now can edit, that we can add a photo,
那么我们可以编辑它，然后把它添加进photo里

299
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,601
just by taking a picture with the camera, okay?
仅仅通过使用手机的相机拍摄的照片

300
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,403
That's what we're gonna do here.
这就是我们接下去要做的

301
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,038
So let's go back to tracks.
所以让我们先回到Trax Demo

302
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,340
Here we are in tracks.
这是我们的Demo

303
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,041
Just remember where we are here.
先记住我们在哪儿

304
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:28,478
We've built this thing that allows us to click on
我们已经建立的这些东西允许我们在地图上点击鼠标 

305
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,948
the map and then we can see the images.
然后我们可以看到图像

306
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,482
And we can also drop a pin.
我们也可以添加一个大头针

307
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:36,518
And when we click on the little detail disclosure,
当我们点击它时会有一些小细节展示出来

308
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,554
we bring up this little new controller right here,
我们在这儿建立了一个新的controller

309
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:41,923
where we can edit the name and the info.
在这个controller中我们可以编辑name和info

310
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:45,326
So what I wanna do here is actually use this nice big
我接下来要做的实际上就是利用这个空间

311
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:48,729
space we have at the bottom of our editor to show and
来让我们的编辑者展示和编辑照片

312
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:52,733
edit the photo, okay that goes along with this waypoint.
这需要和这个waypoint一起

313
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:56,370
Now, you might think the first thing I'm gonna do here is go
现在，你可以能会想，首先我会在这里

314
00:12:56,372 --> 00:13:00,040
down to my object palette and grab an image view, down here,
拖一个imageview放在这下面

315
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,442
but I'm not gonna do that, 'kay, and
但我不准备这样做

316
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:05,845
I'm gonna show you kind of a little bit of an interesting
我会向你展示一小部分

317
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,479
trick about ImageViews.
关于imageView有趣的方法

318
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:11,583
One thing about ImageViews is that they have an intrinsic
关于imageViews的第一个问题就是他们都有一个固有的size

319
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:13,040
size.

320
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,496
They're like labels.
类似于label

321
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:15,952
They want to be the size of their image, okay, for
出于auto layout的目的，他们会和他们的image的size

322
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,488
auto-layout purposes.
保持一致

323
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,456
They strongly want to be that size.
他们会自动的变成这个size

324
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,557
You have a question, sorry.
[学生提问]

325
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,491
>> [INAUDIBLE].
声音太小，听不清

326
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:22,392
>> No, I'm not.
不，我不会

327
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:25,428
Close.
关闭

328
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,830
Let's see here, close.
我们看这儿

329
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:31,400
[INAUDIBLE].
声音太小，听不清

330
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:34,069
So you guys are only gonna get it from, starting from here,
你们可以通过这样，从这里开始

331
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:35,837
cuz I'm not gonna go back to the start.
因为我不想回到刚开始的地方

332
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,875
I'm [INAUDIBLE] much.
声音太小，听不清

333
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:44,878
Okay, so if I have auto-layout and I drag an image view in
好的，如果我使用auto layout接着我拖了一个image View进工程里

334
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,847
there, then when I set the image, it's gonna wanna make
然后当我设置image，由于autolayout，这将会

335
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:50,683
the auto layout huge because the image is gonna be big,
让image的size变大

336
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:53,252
especially if I have a high resolution photo, so
尤其是在当我有一张分辨率很高的照片时

337
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:54,787
I don't want that to happen,
我不希望这样的情况发生

338
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:57,723
I want this image view to be the size I say it's gonna be.
我想要这个image View 的size能和我设置的一样

339
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:01,159
Basically I want it to use whatever space is available
基本上我想要它的尺寸能在我设置的空间里

340
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:01,992
and no more.
不会变大

341
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:04,661
So, well,
那么

342
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:07,329
kind of a cool way to do this is to use a generic UIView.
使用UIView这个类就是一种很酷的方法来解决这个问题

343
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:09,299
So, instead of taking a UIView,
因此，我放一个UIView在这儿

344
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:11,801
I'm gonna pull a generic UIView out here.
而不是放一个image View

345
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:14,403
Now, by the way, when you put a generic UIView out,
顺便说一句，当你拖了一个UIView出来

346
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,905
sometimes it's hard to see what the heck is going on
有时这是很难在heck上看到的

347
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,440
because it's white on white.
因为UIView是白色的，背景也是白色的

348
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,409
So a lot of times when I do that, I think I might have
所以每当我要这样做时

349
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:24,612
mentioned this before, I'll just set it to some other
我认为我要先暂时改变UIView的颜色来避免这个问题

350
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,915
color for a moment, so that while I'm editing it here in
这样做了之后，当我在storyboard编辑它时

351
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,285
the storyboard I can size it and set up its constraints and
我可以清楚地看到它的尺寸和设置它和其他控件的约束

352
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,454
all that stuff, and I can kinda see what's going on.
这个过程都可以被很好地观察出来

353
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:39,025
Okay, so let's put this thing in reasonable spots over here,
OK，让我们把这个UIView拉伸到合理的位置

354
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:42,995
let's set some constraints for it, put some vertical
然后再为它添加一些约束

355
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:46,598
spacing to the top there, trailing over to here,
为控件添加一些垂直的约束，拖到这儿

356
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,302
this guy over to here, and I'll put this one down to
这个控件覆盖在这个范围上，接着我会为它 

357
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:53,471
the bottom, and we used to have a constraint
添加一个与底部空间的约束

358
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:57,208
on this one to the bottom which we want to get rid of.
此时，我们需要放弃一个底部的约束

359
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,143
Where is that?
这个约束在哪儿呢？

360
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,077
Bottom of space to bottom layup, it's this one.
Bottom of space to bottom layup,就是这个约束 

361
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,447
And, we could also, while we're here,
当然，我们也可以在这里设置

362
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,882
make sure this is standard value, 'kay?
保证这个约束的值是标准的参数

363
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,116
So that look's good.
看起来好像没什么问题

364
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,319
This guy also standard value.
这个约束条件也要设置成标准的参数

365
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,388
All right.
好的

366
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,456
So, we've got this UIView in here, and really what we're
现在我们在这里设置好了一个UIView

367
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,925
gonna do is put the UIImageView inside of it.
然后我们的目的是要在里面放一个UIImageView

368
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:19,327
And I'm gonna manage it manually.
我要手动的操作它  

369
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,363
So I'm gonna size it to the right size
我先按照我在代码里写的那样

370
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,598
that I want in code, okay?
设置好它正确地size

371
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,501
And that way, it'll never be trying to fight the auto
通过这样，这就不会因为和auto layout的

372
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:29,736
layout system to make things really big,
系统冲突而造成控件变得非常的大

373
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:31,971
and smash other things off the screen, or
然后把其他的控件挤出了屏幕

374
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,008
make my popover really gigantic, or things like that.
或是使我的storyboard中得视图变得非常巨大 

375
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,175
'Kay?
理解了吗？

376
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,544
So, let's go ahead and do that.
所以让我们接下去做

377
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:39,678
Gonna go over here.
把这两边收起

378
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,330
I'm gonna go back,
回到代码上

379
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,981
this is our editable waypoint view controller,
这是我们可编辑的waypoint view controller，

380
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,049
the view controller for this whole thing.
这个view controller 都是为了这个控件而写的

381
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:49,286
So I'm gonna go down here,
我们看这个代码的下面几行

382
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:56,092
let's create a new little mark for images.
先为这个images创建一个新的标记

383
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:57,410
Okay.
好了

384
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,727
So this'll be our image handling area right here.
这这区域将成为我们处理image的地方

385
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,064
So I'm gonna control drag from this generic view out here.
所以我先按住control将这个巨大的view拖到代码里

386
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:06,134
This is not my ImageView, this is my, what did I call this,
这不是我们创建的imageView，这是我。。。怎么说呢？

387
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,035
container?
容器？

388
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:09,570
Yeah, ImageViewContainer.
对！ImageView 的容器

389
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:13,307
Okay, this is going to be just a generic UIView, see,
好了，这将会是以个巨大的UIView，看，

390
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,342
that contains my image view.
在它里面包含了我的image view

391
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:19,579
And so my image view is actually gonna be something
通过我写的代码，让我的image view

392
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,881
here that I create in code.
真正发挥它的作用

393
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,983
I'll just say equals UIImageView, actually.
事实上，他就是一个UIImageView

394
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:28,854
Okay, so there's my image view and on my didSet here,
好的，这就是我将在didset方法里设置好的image view

395
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:32,791
when this thing is set, I'll go ahead and put that image
我要让image view显示在这个

396
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:36,994
view into this thing by just saying image view controller,
image view container上面通过调用

397
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,028
add sub view.
addSubvuew方法

398
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,766
Image view, capitalize this for me.
imageView会调用这个方法

399
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:48,704
Okay, so I basically just put that image view in there and.
好的，现在我基本上已经image View放到上面了

400
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,572
Let's see, what's the problem here?
然后我们看看，这儿有什么问题？

401
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:56,478
It's, oh, imageViewContainer, yeah, thanks.
应该是imageViewContainer

402
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,980
ImageViewContainer, too used to typing in controller.
应该是imageViewContainer，太容易和controller混淆了

403
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:02,249
Let's make this bigger, too, by the way, so
让我们这个放大一点

404
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:04,351
we can see what we're doing.
看清楚我们写的代码

405
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,402
Okay.
好的

406
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:06,452
So, everyone see what I did there?
大家都看得清我写的吗？

407
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,188
I just created this generic UI View,
我在这里创建了一个UIView类

408
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,622
I put the image view in there.
然后放一个imageView在上面

409
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,691
I'm gonna have to manage the size myself, though.
这样做是因为我不想让imageView的size

410
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:13,425
I'm not gonna do autolayout in there, et cetera.
与autolayout系统发生冲突

411
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:16,228
And, basically, I'm just gonna always set the image
然后，基本上，我就是希望当我设置图片时

412
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,164
view inside to be the right aspect ratio for my image, but
它的像素是正确地

413
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,865
no wider than my container view.
而且不会比这个容器还要宽

414
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:25,102
And if my overall controller gives me no space for
如果我的容器没有办法放下我的image View

415
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:29,006
the view image, then I don't get it, okay?
那么我将无法得到它

416
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:31,808
And also anytime my image changes I'm going to ask for
当然，当我在任何时间改变了image之后 

417
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,544
more space by resetting my preferred content size.
我会需要更大的空间来重新设置内容变成我想要的size

418
00:17:34,546 --> 00:17:36,879
Remember preferred content size for the pop over?
记住，弹出框中内容的size会改变

419
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,113
And so I'm going to ask for more space.
然后我会请求更大的空间

420
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,548
I may or may not get it.
我可能会也可能不会得到它

421
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,817
Cause pop over might be near the edge, but I'll ask for
因为弹出框可能会靠近容器的边界，但是我将请求空间

422
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,753
it and we'll see that code in just a second here.
我们马上会看到这部分的代码

423
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:47,955
Alright, so I got that.
好的，我先找到这里

424
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,224
Here is some code.
这就是这一部分代码

425
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:52,859
Let's put some code in here to do that.
我们在这里添加一些代码

426
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:55,995
I have this extension that I added to my way point
我在我的way point controller中加入这个拓展

427
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:59,232
controller and it has this method update image.
然后这个方法会更新image

428
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:02,234
Now update image, the reason I snippeted this in here instead
现在更新image，我在这里写了一小段而不是把这所有都在你看到之前

429
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,903
of typing all into you've seen it all before, right?
打出来的原因你后面会知道

430
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:06,738
I'm dispatching to another thread,
我使用GCD在另一个线程上进行

431
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,173
I'm getting the image data.
我正在获取image的数据

432
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:11,209
Here I'm getting the URL and getting the image.
在这里我得到了URl和image

433
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:13,811
I'm dispatching back to the main thread,
然后我调用这个方法回到主线程

434
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:16,213
I'm setting the image in my ImageView so
此时设置imageView的image

435
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:19,583
this is just not worth our time to go through this again.
这样就不会让我们在这个过程上浪费时间

436
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:21,217
We've done this two or three times.
我们已经这样做过很多次了

437
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:24,854
But I am calling this function here makeRoomForImage, and
当时我将这个函数称作makeRoomForImage

438
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:28,124
all that makeRoomForImage is, it sees if the image is
然后，如果image比之前的

439
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:30,492
any bigger than the last image we had.
image大

440
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:33,161
And if so, it updates the preferred content size to
出现了这样的情况，这个函数会调整content的size

441
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,130
give it a little bit of a extra height.
给它一些额外的height

442
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:37,732
And this extra height might be negative if we just set
但是这样额外的height可能会有一些不好的效果

443
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,333
the image to nil, for example,
比如说，当我们设置的image为nil

444
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,235
it might try to collapse it back down.
这可能会使content变小

445
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:44,604
So again, this is just pertaining to what we prefer
所以，这些都是关于我们愿意让我们的content size	

446
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,706
our overall content size to be.
的大小变为什么样

447
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,809
And if we can get this space then my generic UI view that
倘若我们能够让这个空间比我们在

448
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:52,278
contains my image is going to get bigger.
UIVew这个类中的image需要的更大

449
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,848
And there's going to be more space for me and I can make my
那么我就有更多的空间让UIImageView更大

450
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,117
UIImageView bigger, see more of my UIImageView.
在更大程度上的看到我的UIImageView

451
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,751
Okay?
懂我意思吗？

452
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,403
So that's it.
因此就是这样

453
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,054
So we do need to update this image.
所以我们真的需要对这个image进行校正

454
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:04,855
We'll do it in updateUI, right?
我们会在updataUI这个函数里处理这些问题

455
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:08,992
So we have updateUI up here that updates the text fields,
我们在上面的updateUI函数中已经有了校正text fields的内容

456
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:12,962
so we also wanna update our image there in that as well.
然后我们同样在这儿也需要有校正图片的

457
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:14,163
Okay, so that's it.
好的，就是这样写

458
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:17,166
That's how all that's necessary here to display
这就是为什么保证图片

459
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:19,234
the image in my view controller and
在view中展示的size

460
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,936
keep it's size contained.
是非常有必要地

461
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:24,472
So let's go ahead and kinda put a test image into our
我们接下去放一张测试的图片

462
00:19:24,474 --> 00:19:27,842
edited waypoints just to see if this is working.
在我们编辑waypoints的地方，看看它是怎么运作的

463
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:31,812
So I'm gonna go back to GPXViewController and
因此，我会回到GPXViewController

464
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:35,982
where I add a waypoint here by dropping I'm gonna
然后在我addWaypoints的函数里

465
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:38,018
say waypoint.links.
写下我叫做waypoint.links

466
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,252
Let's append.
让我们加上它

467
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:43,255
I'm gonna append a new GPX link,
我想要添加一个新的GPX link

468
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:49,294
that's the thing that has the reference to a URL,
这个属性带有一个URL

469
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:54,599
to the image or whatever and so we'll do http
这个URL会连接到一张图片，然后会在

470
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:59,336
CS193p Stanford images panorama.
这个URL上请求这张图片

471
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:01,071
Okay.
好了

472
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,805
I'm just picking one of the ones we had there at random.
我只是在我们有的图片中随机取了一张

473
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:06,009
So, now this waypoint has a link, okay?
所以，这个waypoint有了一个link

474
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:09,845
Just like the waypoints that came out of that GPX file,
就像是从GPX 文件中出现的waypoint一样

475
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:11,447
they have links also.
他们同样也有link的属性

476
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:14,816
One other thing we're gonna need to do is over here in our
我们还要做的另一件事是在MKGPX中

477
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:17,519
MK GPX right here, our EditableWaypoint.
关于EditableWaypoint这个类

478
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,554
Right now, it gets its thumbnail and
现在，它可以获取到它的thumbnail和image URL

479
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:22,223
image URL by looking them up by this type thing.
通过这两个条件

480
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,991
Thumbnail type, large type.
thumbnail的类型中的large类型 

481
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:28,028
And just for the purpose of the demo, I'm gonna make it
然后仅仅是为了我们demo的目的

482
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,898
just return the first link in its link list of links.
我让让它返回在以列表形式展示的link中的第一条link

483
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,237
So let's go down here and just say return links.first.URL.
所以我们直接把下面这个改成links.first.url

484
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,539
And then we'll have the thumbnail be the same as
这样之后我们就可以让thumbnail的得到的内容

485
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,241
the image URL, so it won't have a separate thumbnail.
和image Url获取的一样，这样做也不会出现一个不同的thumbnail

486
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,945
I'm just kinda cheating this really quick so
为了让我们真实快速地在UI中看到图片

487
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,847
that we can see some image in our UI.
我在这里躲开了一些不必要的设置

488
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,683
So let's go ahead and run this and see what happens this is
所以让我们接下去运行这个项目看看会发生什么

489
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,519
for, oh we got, what do we got here, oh sorry override,
噢，报错了！

490
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,820
we gotta override these.
我应该要在前面加上override

491
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,423
Override.
加上override

492
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,892
Okay.
好了

493
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,193
All right.
编译通过

494
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:05,493
So I'm gonna run this here, in the simulator.
让我们看看在模拟器中运行的效果

495
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,896 
We'll switch the device in a second here.
这个设备会很快被打开

496
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:08,930
All right.
好了

497
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:10,432
So here we are.
这就是我们的模拟器

498
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,933
You all remember this UI I've got here.
我们都记得这个UI，我刚才设置的

499
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:14,635
And I've got these images on the left, for there.
接着我在左边获取了这些图片

500
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,271
So I'm gonna go ahead and drop one for
我接下来想要通过在这儿用鼠标点击一下

501
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,339
an editable waypoint here.
获取一个可编辑的waypoint

502
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:21,107
So I'm gonna click on it, you can see.
我选中它

503
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,042
And there it is, there's our panorama.
你能看到，这是我们请求的那张叫做panorama的图片

504
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:25,678
See, I used that as the default image, and
看到了吗？我将这个图片设置成默认的了

505
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,514
if I click our editor here, there's panorama, it appears.
然后如果我点击了按钮，这张图片就会出现

506
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,583
Okay, so, that's kind of fun and
好的，这挺有趣的吧

507
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:35,286
notice that that's a very wide aspect ratio, but it only made
然后我们可以注意到这张图的像素虽然很大

508
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:38,089
enough space to do that, and so we can edit it.
但我们还是有足够的空间去编辑它

509
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:41,792
So, now we want to be able to change this view.
现在，我想要能够修改这个view

510
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,026
We don't want it to be panorama.
我不想要这个图片了

511
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:46,629
I only just showed that to show you how this would work.
现在我们只能看到这张图片

512
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,631
So we need to go back to add some UI,
要想实现这个效果，我们需要回到之前的页面上，然后添加一个ui控件

513
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,934
some button that lets us take a picture with the camera and
一些可以控制让我们使用相机拍下的照片

514
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,335
put that here instead.
然后替代这张图片的button

515
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:55,303
Okay, so that's what we're going to do now.
好的，这是我们接下去要做的

516
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,605
Let's go to our storyboard here.
首先，我们回到storyboard上

517
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,975
I'm gonna put that button like right here, I think.
我想要在这右边添加一个按钮

518
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,877
Let's move this over a little bit and
让我们把这个控件变得小一点

519
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,578
I'm gonna put it right in here.
把右边的空间留出来

520
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,713
I have a nice button for that, or image for
然后我要设置一个按钮

521
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:07,914
that with the camera.
然后给这个按钮设置这个照相机的图片

522
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:13,219
So, let's go ahead and
首先，我们先拖

523
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:16,422
get a button.
个button出来

524
00:22:16,424 --> 00:22:18,523
Okay.
好了

525
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:22,994
Here's a button.
这个一个button

526
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:26,097
Okay so we'll put this button right in here.
然后将这个button放到这边 

527
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,334
Okay I'm going to set this image to be that camera, so
接下来再给这个button设置这个照相机的图片

528
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:34,270
let's go ahead and drag that camera image into our
首先，我们先到images.scassets下

529
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:37,540
XC assets, so here's our image assets.
将camera这张图片拖进去

530
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,342
Drag this guy in here.
把它拖到这儿

531
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:42,544
Okay.
好了

532
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:46,280
We could put higher resolution versions in, et cetera, but
我们可以把它放到更高分辨率的地方，比如2X，3X

533
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,049
we're just gonna use that.
现在我们只要能用就行了

534
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,351
So let's go to Button here.
所以我们回到button上

535
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:52,652
I'm gonna go to the button here and change its image to
我将要把button的图片改成这张camera

536
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:56,556
be the camera, and I don't want the word button on there,
同时，我不想让button上显示任何文字

537
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,558
okay, so here's my button.
好了，button就设置好了

538
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,228
Now we'll do some auto layout here, to get this thing,
接下去，我们要做一些auto layout的工作

539
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,597
in here.
为button加一些约束

540
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:07,965
So I will put this up against this edge.
第一，我要让这个button紧靠着容器的边界

541
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:11,102
Let's put something between here the horizontal spacing.
接着，再为它添加一个水平间距的约束

542
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,839
Let's have these two be center Y.
让这2个控件的中心在Y方向上保持一致

543
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,742
We had another one in here that we'll have to delete now
我们在这个方向上，我们原先有另一个约束，所以我现在要把它删掉

544
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:20,411
because we used to have this thing on this edge, so
因为我们原先在这个控件上添加了靠近边界的约束

545
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:21,545
let's go find that.
现在让我们找到这个冲突的约束

546
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,913
That's trailing space to super view right here.
就是这个trailing Space to SuperView

547
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:28,201
We'll get rid of that.
将它删掉

548
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:32,488
We'll make these to be standard spacing right there.
接下来设置成standard Value

549
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,467
All the rest of it looks like it's standard,
剩下的这些看起来像是标准的

550
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:34,445
must have lined them up perfectly there.
一定要将控件完美的约束好

551
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,423
Any problems, oh, horizontally ambiguous?
仍然存在问题，水平约束不明确

552
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:38,794
Okay.
好的

553
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:42,163
So this guy wants to hug, the button wants to hug itself
由于按照我们设置的约束条件，button需要变得更宽一些

554
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:47,802
because this guy's willing to be as wide as we want.
所以我要调整一下这个button的水平位置

555
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:50,471
It doesn't want to hug down but this one does and
由于button不需要向下紧靠，而另一个控件有这个约束条件

556
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:53,140
the system has to know who gets the space there.
而我们要告诉系统怎么去分配这个空间

557
00:23:53,142 --> 00:23:54,374
So now the frames will be different.
所以现在的frame会和以前不一样

558
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:56,175
Okay let's go down here,
所以让我们点击下面的按钮

559
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:59,778
update our frames make sure everything looks good.
选择update frames 让这些控件彼此的约束条件不冲突

560
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,979
It does.
好的，这样就没问题了

561
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,047
Okay, excellent.
太棒了

562
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,648
So we've added this little button to our UI.
现在我们成功地在我们的UI中加入了这个button

563
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,049
So now we're just gonna have this button.
但现在我们仅仅只是有了这个button

564
00:24:05,051 --> 00:24:07,918
When we click it it's gonna bring up the camera.
当我点击它时，我希望的是能调用系统的相机

565
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,454
So let's go do that.
所以我们还需要做一些配置

566
00:24:10,456 --> 00:24:14,824
All right, I'm just gonna control drag from this button
好的，首先，我要先按住control将这个button

567
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,692
right here, and here.
拖到右边的代码中

568
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:20,629
And it's gonna be an action, we'll call it Take Photo.
为它绑定一个点击事件，我们将这个方法叫做Take Photo

569
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:21,963
That's what it does.
点击这个button将会发生的事情

570
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:25,933
And we don't need any argument, or anything.
我们不需要在这个方法中传入任何参数

571
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:27,301
There's Take Photo.
这是take photo 方法

572
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:29,970
So, in here.
在这个里面

573
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:34,273
All we need to do is create that picker and present it.
我们需要的是创建一个picker然后在这个页面使用present跳转

574
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:37,243
And then we're gonna implement those delegate methods and
接着，我们会实现那些delegate方法

575
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:38,310
we'll be good to go.
这样使用起来会很好

576
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,279
All right, so what do we need to do in here?
那么要想实现这些效果，我们需要在这个方法里写些什么呢？

577
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:43,648
First I'm gonna check and make sure I have a camera.
首要，我要确保我有一个照相机

578
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,351
Actually I'm gonna, first I'm gonna go and
事实上，我要先让我们有足够的空间

579
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,285
give us some space to work with.
来写这些代码

580
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,520
All right.
好了

581
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:53,289
So first I'm gonna check here, and
首先，创建一个if语句

582
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,793
see UIImagePickerController.
判断UIImagePickerController中

583
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,961
If I have a camera available, so
是否我有相机

584
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:02,064
I'm gonna say source type available camera.
我的意思是，这个路径下的相机是否可用

585
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:02,731
Okay?
懂我意思吗？

586
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,132
So if I have a camera,
如果我有相机

587
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:07,168
then I'm gonna set my picker's source type.
那么接下来我要设置picker.sourceType

588
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,338
To be the camera.
为.Camera

589
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,273
Okay?
好吗？

590
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,274
What else have we got?
我们还需要设置picker的哪些属性？

591
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:16,009
Oh, sorry.
喔,抱歉

592
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:18,077
I've got to create my picker.
我应该先创建一个picker对象

593
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,513
So here I'm gonna say let the picker equal UI image picker
所以在这里，我应该先写让picker等于

594
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:23,766
controller.
UIImagePickerController

595
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,018
So when you create it, it's just parentheses, parentheses,
这样做只是初始化了这个对象

596
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,886
you don't have to specify any.
你还没有让他拥有任何特性

597
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:29,854
X-ray information when you're creating it.
比如当你创建它 是给它添加一个X-ray信息

598
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,955
So now I've set the source type.
既然现在我已经设置了它的source type

599
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:34,391
Now here I would maybe, if I was doing video.
现在在这儿，如果我正在处理的是一段视频

600
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:38,395
You know, I would check media types to make sure that media
你懂我意思吗？我应该要确保媒体的类型

601
00:25:38,397 --> 00:25:39,796
type is available.
是可用的

602
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,732
And then I would say picker.mediaTypes equals.
所以接下来我会让picker.mediaTypes等于

603
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:44,166
And then the types I want.
我需要的类型

604
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:48,103
So, in this case I just want image only.
所以，以防万一，我就设置了image类型

605
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:50,571
Okay?
懂了吗？


606
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:55,376
And then we obviously need the picker to set its delegate to
接下来我们显然要设置picker的delegate

607
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:56,176
be self.
为self

608
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:57,694
Okay?
懂吗？

609
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,211
Without the delegate this thing does nothing.
如果没有delegate，这个picker对象什么也做不了

610
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:03,249
We could also set some other fun things here like maybe we
我们当然也可以设置一些其他有趣的东西

611
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:04,450
allow editing.
比如让它的allow editing

612
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:06,335
True?
属性为true

613
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:08,219
So we'll see what that UI looks like.
接下来，我们看下UI会是什么样的

614
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:12,256
And then we can just present.
现在我们可以直接使用present来跳转这个页面

615
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:13,758
ViewController.
viewController参数

616
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,658
The picker.
picker

617
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,258
Animated?
是否需要动画？

618
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,060
Yes.
是的

619
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:18,861
And, we don't wanna find out that a capture has
现在我们发现

620
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:19,846
been put up.
这里报错了

621
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:20,829
And, what else do we got in here?
所以我们需要修改一下

622
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:21,831
Oh, okay.
噢，好的

623
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,799
So this is the famous, oh.
这是一个很多人都会犯的错误

624
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:25,167
Where does this coming from?
这个类是哪儿来的？

625
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,135
So, we have to come up here.
随意我们需要提前声明一下

626
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:33,574
Import MobileCoreServices.
导入MobileCoreServices

627
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:35,209
That takes care of that.
这是你需要注意的地方

628
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:37,811
And this one of course is we don't implement.
这个问题是我们没有声明这个类的代理

629
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,346
UI Image Picker Controller Delegate.
UIImagePickerController 代理

630
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,549
Okay, let's do that, UI Image Picker Controller Delegate.
好的，让我添加进去

631
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,552
Now what's interesting here is that we still have an error
现在有趣的时，我们这样做了之后系统仍然提示有错误

632
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:49,254
once we put this UI Image Picker Controller Delegate
尽管我们已经将UIImagePickerControllerDelegate

633
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:49,921
thing here.
在前面声明了

634
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:52,324
It says.
这个错误提示我们

635
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:54,726
Wave point controller does not conform to UI navigation
Wavepointcontroller并没有遵照

636
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,360
controller delegate.
UINavigationcontroller的代理

637
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:57,494
Why the heck does it say that?
为什么系统会这样提示呢？

638
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:59,930
UI navigation hasn't got anything to do with that.
UINavigtiong 并没有得到任何东西

639
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:02,866
Well that's because the UI image picker controller is
好吧，这样是因为UIImagePickerController是继承自

640
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,702
a UI navigation controller, inherits from it, and
UINavightionController

641
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:07,770
they use the same variable delegate.
他们有相同的变量delegate

642
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:09,589
To be their delegate.
作为他们的代理对象

643
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,407
So, we also have to come up here and say that we are a UI
所以，在这里我们不得不也将UINavigationController添加进去

644
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:14,109
navigation controller delegate, even though we don't
但是我们实际上并不会

645
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:16,845
actually implement any of these methods in the protocol.
使用协议里的任何方法

646
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:17,445
That's fine.
这样就好了

647
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,246
They're all optional.
UINavigationControllerDelegate中的代理方法都是optional的

648
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:20,881
Okay?
懂吗？

649
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:22,515
So, that's a little tricky thing sometimes people don't
所以有时我们可能无法理解但为了避免错误

650
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,017
understand with the picker, but.
我们不得不使用一些技巧

651
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,286
You definitely need to do that.
不过我们在这里确实需要这样去做

652
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:28,554
So, that's all that's required to put that picker on-screen,
总之，这就是将picker在屏幕上展示，所有需要的代码

653
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:30,189
so it's gonna be on-screen and
现在它即将被放到屏幕上

654
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,992
now we just have to implement those delegate methods.
现在我们仅仅还需要实现一些代理方法

655
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:34,760
So, here they are.
让我们看下需要实现哪个方法

656
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:37,229
This one, by the way, is deprecated,
这个方法，顺便说下，已经被官方不推荐使用了

657
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,563
don't use that one.
所以我们不用这个方法

658
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:40,365
Here is the one where they pick something, and
这个方法在选中时会被调用

659
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,832
here is the one where they cancelled.
这个方法取消时会被调用

660
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:42,900
Okay?
懂吗？

661
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:43,967
So let's do the one where they picked.
所以我们先实现当它被选中时调用

662
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:46,286
Something, so
这个方法

663
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:48,604
I'm just going to say that the image they picked is the info,
我想说的是当图片被选中时image = info

664
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:52,042
that info dictionary that's being passed along here.
然后info的参数将会作为字典类型被传递

665
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:54,410
And there's a bunch of constants in
这是一组在UIImagePickerController中的常量

666
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:57,847
UIImagePickerController, and one of them here,
现在我需要的是他们中的一个

667
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,883
ImagePickerControllerEditedIm- age, so
ImagePickerControllerEditedImage

668
00:28:00,885 --> 00:28:04,819
that's the edited image, and I wanna get it as a UIImage.
这是已经被编辑的图片，然后我现在要让他转化为UIImage

669
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:07,722
Okay, because this info is,
因为info的value是AnyObject

670
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:12,559
AnyObject is the value, so I have to cast it here.
所以我们在这需要计算一下

671
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:16,129
If I couldn't get the image, okay, the edited image,
如果我不能得到这张被编辑过的图片

672
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:17,864
then I'm gonna just try and
那么接下来我将要尝试

673
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,334
set the image equal to the unedited image, which is the
让这个图片等于未被编辑时的图片   

674
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:24,270
ImagePickerControllerOriginal- Image.
就是初始时的图片

675
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:27,773
As UI image.
作为UIImage的类

676
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:30,876
Now you might say, why am I doing this line of code right
现在你可能会问，为什么这行代码是正确地

677
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:33,945
here because I'm clearly allowing editing up here.
因为我在之前已经明确地声明了allowing editing为true

678
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:35,580
Yeah, we're allowing editing today but
是的，今天我们允许编辑

679
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:37,282
if I some day just said, eh,
如果我在之前的某一天说过

680
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,983
I'm not gonna let people edit and I change this to false,
呃，我不想让人们编辑和改变图片

681
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,635
well, all of the sudden,
好吧，突然就发生了

682
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,286
this code would break if I didn't have this nice little.
如果不将allowing editing设为true的话

683
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,904
Thing here.
代码会崩溃

684
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,521
So I'm thinking ahead a little bit to make it so that
所以我提前做了这个准备

685
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:48,391
a change somewhere else in my code won't break me here.
防止我的代码会突然出现崩溃

686
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,559
Okay?
懂了吗？

687
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,726
And so I've got the image.
好了，接下来我要获取这张图片

688
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,728
So I'm just gonna set the,
然后开始对它进行一些设置

689
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,330
my image views image equal to that.
让这个属性等于它

690
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:57,232
And I'm gonna make room for it.
然后我再为它设置空间

691
00:28:57,234 --> 00:29:00,068
Okay, that's this makeRoomForImage that I told
这是我之前说的makeRoomForImage函数

692
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,369
you I added down here.
我将会执行下面的这些代码

693
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:02,670
Okay?
ok？

694
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,938
And that's it.
那么就是这样了

695
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,773
I've got everything, so I'm just gonna dismiss.
我已经将这一切都下好了，接下来只要dismiss这个view的行了

696
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:08,141
And notice, I'm not saying,
在这里要注意

697
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:10,076
presenting view controller dismiss here.
我没有说将presentingViewController dismiss掉

698
00:29:10,078 --> 00:29:11,944
Because I am the presenting view controller.
因为此时的页面就是presentingViewController

699
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:13,712
So I'm just saying, dismiss true.
我仅仅是设置dismiss为true

700
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:17,549
And completion.
然后执行completion block

701
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,668
Okay?
懂我意思吗？

702
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,786
We have to do the same thing here for the cancelled case.
我们在取消时调用的代理方法中也要做同样的事情

703
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:22,486
Okay?
好嘛

704
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:24,221
But in the cancelled case,
只是在在取消时调用的代理方法中

705
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:27,457
I'm only gonna do this dismiss right here, okay?
我仅仅需要调用dismiss方法就行了

706
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,693
Obviously, I'm not gonna grab the image or
很显然，让他们退出以后我想再

707
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:30,993
anything if they cancel.
去抓取图片或任何东西

708
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,094
All right?
好的

709
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:35,714
So let's take a look at this.
让我们看下实际运行情况

710
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:39,333
Let's look at this, let's go on iPhone 6 plus here.
在这里选择在iPhone 6 plus上运行

711
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:40,635
There it is, okay?
运行成功了

712
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,704
Actually, let's go.
好的，让我们操作看看

713
00:29:42,706 --> 00:29:44,872
We still have our little panoram in here.
我们仍然可以在这里看到我们之前设置的panoram图片

714
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:48,042
Let's go to that really quick.
让我们快点儿回到这张图片的代码上

715
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:51,712
That's over here.
找找在哪儿

716
00:29:51,714 --> 00:29:55,849
So we'll just go back here and we'll comment this out.
所以我们只要回到之前的代码上 然后把这句代码注释掉

717
00:29:55,851 --> 00:30:00,453
So that if we're testing again in the future we can go
这样做呢，如果我将来我们还要进行测试的时候

718
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:01,487
back to it.
我们只要把注释取消掉就好了

719
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,589
All right.
好了

720
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,690
But let's get this code back up on the screen here so
接下来还是回到我们之前写完了的代码上

721
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:06,758
you can see it.

722
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,359
All right, so here's our photo stuff.
好了，这是我们处理photo的代码

723
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:13,464
All right, so
那么接下来

724
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:20,337
let's run again.
我们再运行看看

725
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:22,038
All right so I'm gonna drop a pin.
好的我想要选中一个大头针

726
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,573
Notice that we don't have an image right here.
注意在这个上面我们已经没有图片了

727
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,558
Okay?
发现了吗？

728
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,542
It took away that little test image.
我们已经将那个小测试图片移走了

729
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:28,377
And clicking our edit thing and
然后点击我们编辑按钮

730
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:30,211
we've got this big space now.
我们跳转到了这个大页面上

731
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:33,614
There's that big grey box right there because I set that
这下面有一大块儿灰色的区域

732
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:35,850
UI image in my storyboard to be grey.
因为我在storyboard设置了UIImage的背景色是灰色的

733
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:36,684
Right?
还记得吗？

734
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:39,419
So let's go look at that.
所以呢当我们看到它时

735
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,653
See over here, this is gray.
会发现这会是灰色的

736
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:42,855
So really, when I'm shipping,
所以在这里我应该注重这些细节

737
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,157
I'm obviously gonna go here, and
很显然我要回到storyboard中

738
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,061
set this back to its standard, which is clear basically.
然后把这个背景色改成透明的

739
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:50,562
Okay?
对吗？

740
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,797
Back to our code.
回到我们的代码中

741
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,698
All right.
好了

742
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,631
So we're gonna take a photo here.
所以我们将要在这儿拍一张照片

743
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,366
I'm gonna press that little camera.
我将要点击camera按钮

744
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:58,068
Okay, camera.
嗯，camera

745
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,137
And you can see camera comes up right here.
接着你马上就回看到系统的相机被调用了

746
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:04,674
And this was helicopter skiing.
我们将要坐直升机和滑雪

747
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,608
So let's look at our favorite hat.
所以我们看看我们最爱的帽子

748
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,910
Ski hat, we got our favorite ski hat.
滑雪帽，我们得到了最爱的滑雪帽

749
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:10,578
It's R2D2.
它叫R2D2

750
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,314
Actually it's better than R2D2.
实施上它比R2D2还好

751
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:15,616
There a little San Francisco Giants R2D2.
这是一个三藩市巨人队的

752
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:18,318
Okay, so we're gonna take this picture.
好的，我们将要拍下这张照片

753
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,621
Okay, so we can now crop it.
好的，我们可以伸缩和放大这张照片

754
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:22,706
Okay?
对吗？

755
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:23,790
We could zoom in on the really important part.
我们可以放大到真正重要的部位

756
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,024
All right?
对吗？

757
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:28,160
And then we can say Use Photo, and it comes back and
然后我们可以使用这张照片，然后回到刚才的页面上

758
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,062
it appears in our thing here.
这张照片在我们的容器中显示了

759
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:31,630
If we take a different picture,
我们夜可以拍摄不同的照片

760
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:34,599
maybe if we decide, okay, we want the whole hat, all right,
或许我们想要能显示整张帽子的图片

761
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,101
we'll zoom out there, and we'll use that photo.
我们可以缩小一下，然后使用这个照片

762
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,369
We got it, okay?
我们做到了，对吗？

763
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:41,572
Now, of course, this is not going to save this, so
现在，当然，这样做不会存储这张照片

764
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,875
as soon as I go away and come back, it's not there and
所以只要我离开这个页面，再选中这个大头针，这张图片不会显示

765
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:48,478
that's because we need to save that picture somewhere.
这就需要我们在的操作中添加将图片保存在某地的方法

766
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,647
And we're gonna save that in the file system with our
那么接下来，我们就要通过接下去的例子

767
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:54,767
next demo.
把照片存在我们的文件系统

768
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:57,886
Let's take a quick look what this looks like on the iPad.
我们再快速看一下，这个demo在iPad上运行的样子

769
00:31:57,888 --> 00:32:05,660
Make sure that it works over there as well.
确保demo在iPad上运行也没有问题

770
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:06,327
All right.
好的

771
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,496
So, we'll drop a pin here.
接下来，我在这儿选择一个大头针

772
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,130
We'll go there.
点击按钮

773
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:13,033
Bring up our little popover.
出现一个小的弹出框

774
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:17,603
Take a photo, again we get the huge size screen.
点击拍照，我们跳转到了一个巨大尺寸的屏幕上

775
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,338
We'll have to do front facing camera,
我们不得不使用前置摄像头

776
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,706
because I got it on this thing.
因为后置摄像头被什么东西遮住了

777
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,775
Here we go, this R2-D2 hat there.
又来了，这是我们的R2D2帽子

778
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,643
There we go.
拍下照片

779
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:26,477
All right.
好了

780
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,545
And there it is.
显示正常

781
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:28,912
And so we can put it into our little popover,
我们成功将这个照片在弹出框中显示出来了

782
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,414
which is kind of fun.
看起来挺有趣的

783
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,915
And because we have that generic UI view, and
然后因为我们先前设置过了这个UIView类

784
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:34,884
I asked for a bigger preferred content size, it made some
所以我请求了一个更大更适合内容的尺寸，

785
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,820
more size and then the generic UI image view got bigger.
这样做可以让UIImageView这个类在容器里有足够的尺寸来变大

786
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,923
And so then I was able to make the image view inside of it
那么接下来我就可以让容器里的ImageView变得

787
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,490
bigger.
更大

788
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,525
Okay.
好了

789
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:45,627
Excellent.
太棒了

790
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:47,728
Okay, let's go back to the slides, and
好的，那么我们接下来回到幻灯片上

791
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:51,299
learn a little bit about storing stuff, and
学习一点儿关于存储部分的知识

792
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,835
then we can come back and store that image.
然后我们就能回到我们的项目上把图片保存起来

793
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:58,905
All right, so there are a number of ways to make
这是一些可以把东西存在你设备上

794
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:01,775
things persist on your device.
的方法

795
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:03,810
In other words,
换句话说

796
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:05,844
some data that you want to live forever on your device.
就是一些你想要让它永远存在你设备上的数据

797
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,146
Okay. Even as your application
比如你退出了应用

798
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:08,847
is quit, the phone gets powered off,
手机断电了

799
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:10,749
whatever, you want that stuff to exist.
或是什么情况，你想要你的数据仍然存在

800
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:13,551
So I'm gonna talk about four different ways.
所以我准备讲讲这4种不同的方式

801
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:15,186
You already know one, actually,
事实上，有一种方法你已经知道了

802
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:16,487
which is NS user defaults.
就是NSUserDefaults

803
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:17,855
Okay.
还记得吗？

804
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:19,222
That's a really simple, kind of small amount.
这主要针对是一种简单的，小数量的数据存储

805
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:21,425
This is for bigger data, these four things.
而这4种是针对更大型的数据存储方式

806
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:24,361
The first two, I'm just gonna really, briefly pass through.
前两种，我仅仅就简单的介绍一下

807
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:26,295
I'm barely even gonna talk about them.
我几乎很少的提及他们

808
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,165
Because, really, you're certainly not gonna use them,
因为这些技术你以后真的不会去用他们

809
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,133
I don't think, in your final project.
在你的最终项目里，我不认为

810
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:35,704
Maybe some SQL master out there will be doing some SQL
或许一些精通SQL的人会去做一些根SQL相关的

811
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:37,472
thing.
事情

812
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,239
But I don't think anyone will use that.
但我还是不推荐大家去使用

813
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:41,876
But then the File System and Core Data, I know a lot of you
但是File System和Core Data，我听到过很多人

814
00:33:41,878 --> 00:33:43,911
are doing Core Data as your final project.
正在使用Core Data 比如在你们的最终项目里

815
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,045
And that's a great,
这是很好的

816
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:46,178
not covered in lecture thing, by the way.
顺便说一下，不仅仅涉及在课堂上接触的知识

817
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:47,580
Even though I'm gonna talk about it today,
尽管我今天我说关于这方面的知识

818
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,148
that doesn't mean I'm covering it in lecture,
但这并不意味着我能在课堂上把关于这个知识的方方面面都说清楚

819
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,216
I'm barely gonna talk about it.
我几乎很少能够这样

820
00:33:50,218 --> 00:33:52,584
But, so I know I lot of you are doing that.
所以，我知道你们很多都会做到提前预习

821
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:54,086
And some of you wanna use the File System, also.
当然你们也有一部分想要使用File System

822
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,820
You're reading and writing files from the File System.
在你的文件系统中读或者写数据

823
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:57,955
So hopefully, this will get you up to speed there.
总之，我希望为了能在课堂上更好的理解大家都可以提前预习

824
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,490
So let's talk about Archiving.
那么首先我先介绍一下Archiving

825
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:04,094
Archiving is a way to store a graph of objects,
Archiving是一种存储一个对象的方式

826
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:06,029
okay, on to disc.
是的，在磁盘上

827
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:08,998
And those objects don't have to be property lists.
而且被存储的对象不需要有所有属性的目录

828
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,300
So they don't have to be array, dictionary, date,
所以他们不需要是数组，字典，或是date

829
00:34:11,302 --> 00:34:12,852
whatever.
等类型

830
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:14,403
Because that's all we can put in NSUserDefaults, right?
因为他们都可以使用NSUserDefaults来存储对吗？

831
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:16,138
And NSUserDefaut is for small things.
所以NSUserDefaut是针对小型的数据的

832
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,240
But if we want to store big things, bigger object graphs,
但是如果我想要存储大型的数据，更大的对象

833
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:21,109
and we want a lot more flexibility.
我们就需要一个更灵活的方式

834
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,210
Well, that's where we use Archiving.
是的，这就是我们使用Archiving的原因

835
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:27,748
And, Archiving can archive any tree of objects as long
只要一个对象实现了Archiving的两个方法

836
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,418
as all of them implement these two methods,
那么使用Archiving就可以存储这个对象的所有分支属性

837
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,288
encodeWithCoder and an init method that reads themselves
encodeWithCoder 这个函数和

838
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,090
back in from a coder.
一个用来读取他们自身的init方法

839
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:40,759
So encodeWithCoder basically writes them out,
所以encodeWithCoder这个函数基本上就是将他们写出来

840
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,695
writes themselves out, basically as a dictionary.
基于字典的形式将对象自身写出来

841
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:46,798
Okay, and then encode, and then init will instantiate
然后再进行编码，当这些对象需要被读取时

842
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,833
the object when it gets read back in,
init方法会初始化他们

843
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:51,235
reading that stuff from that dictionary.
从字典中读取对象的属性

844
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:52,602
So where is this used?
所以这种技术一般会在哪儿用到？

845
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:55,372
Your storyboard is archived.
storyboard就是运用这种方式存储的

846
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:57,607
So all the things in your archive,
你所有的东西都会在这个存档文件中

847
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,177
all of those ui views, all those ui view controllers,
所有的UIView，UIViewController

848
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:02,811
they are all encodable.
他们都是可以编码的

849
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:05,614
Okay, they implement this NSCoding protocol.
首先，他们实现了NSCoding 协议

850
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,749
And they all get written out.
然后，他们全被写了下来

851
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:10,918
Basically, when the storyboard is saved, this whole object
基本上，当你的storyboard被保存了，整个对象的图表

852
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,988
graph, the entire thing, all the buttons, everything in
整个对象，所有的button

853
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,924
there gets written out using this Archiving mechanism.
在上面的所有东西，都会基于Archiving机制被写下来

854
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:20,527
And that's why we have that weird init thing with UI view
所以这就是为什么我们调用init方法创建一个UIViewController

855
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:23,763
controller and UI view where there was always this
或是UIView对象时一直会需要一个

856
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:25,598
required init coder thing.
叫做init coder的属性

857
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
That's because they participate in this Archiving.
那是因为他们都使用了Archiving机制

858
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:30,135
Now, I would not recommend to you if you had a graph of
现在，尽管我不推荐，如果你有对象需要存储

859
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:32,838
objects, you know like, I want to make them persist.
你需要让他们持久化

860
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,673
I think I'll archive them.
我知道我可以使用Archive

861
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,425
I wouldn't do it.
不过我还是不会这么做

862
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,176
I would use one of the other mechanisms I'm gonna talk
我宁愿使用另外一种我今天不会说的

863
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,861
about today.
机制

864
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:41,545
Okay, this is really is great for story boards and
当然Archiving机制是非常适合storyboard存储的

865
00:35:41,547 --> 00:35:44,081
it really is the right thing for story boards but
这也确实对storyboard非常好

866
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,166
I'm not sure that for
但我不确定

867
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,250
arbitrary data storage if it really makes a lot of sense.
这样主观的对数据保存是否真的有意义

868
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:50,637
Okay.
懂了吗？

869
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:53,022
All right SQL, some of you are database experts and
接下来关于SQL，我知道你们中有一些人是数据库的专家

870
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,324
there is SQLite on the iPhone.
在iPhone上也会用到SQLite数据库

871
00:35:55,326 --> 00:35:58,060
SQL is for those of you who are not database experts,
SQL语句是为了帮助那些对数据库不是非常精通的人用的

872
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:01,063
SQL is basically a programming language for databases.
SQL是基于数据库的一种编程语言

873
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:04,599
Okay, for creating tables and columns and rows and
用于创建表的列和行

874
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,067
tables and all that.
还有关于表的所有信息


875
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:08,903
And you can, if you have a bunch of code lying around
当然你也可以，如果你有一堆需要使用SQL语句

876
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:11,072
that you had to write to a SQL database,
写入数据库的代码

877
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:13,207
then you could certainly use SQLite.
接下来你才可以使用SQLite数据库了

878
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:15,175
And the next thing I'm gonna talk about, or
接下去我将要说的东西

879
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:17,744
the thing I'm gonna talk about the end here, Core Data,
或是我将在这里介绍关于数据库的最后的知识，Core Data，

880
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,212
it uses SQL underneath, okay.
当然，它也是基于SQL的

881
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:23,015
It's writing all its data to an SQL database as well.
它也会将所有的数据写入一个SQL数据库

882
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:25,117
But probably not gonna access it directly.
但是很有可能不会直接获取这个数据库

883
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,551
The interface,
这个接口

884
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:30,988
the programming interface to SQLite is like a C API.
程序与SQLite连接的接口类似于C语言中的一个API

885
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,325
It'll work in Swift cuz Swift has compatibility with C APIs.
这在Swift中同样有效是因为Swift语言与C的API是兼容的

886
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,994
But it's a little hard to use cuz it's gonna have
但是这样使用起来可能会有些困难

887
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:40,063
weird things like, you know, pointers into memory and
因为这样会出现一些奇怪的东西，比如说

888
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,732
things like that, that Swift doesn't really,
类似于指针进入内存中的概念，这在Swift语言中是没有这种概念的

889
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,334
it has ways to adapt to this.
它有其他的途径来实现这种概念

890
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,736
So that you can do it, but it's not really native,
尽管你还是可以实现这个效果，但这样不是语言原生的

891
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,971
it's not part of Swift's way of doing things.
这不是Swift语言处理东西的方法

892
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,240
So it'll be a little odd for those of you who are used to
所以对于那些正在使用Swift或是尝试使用Swift语言

893
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,443
Swift, to try and program this SQL API using Swift.
来编辑SQL API的人来说，这样会有些奇怪

894
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:56,511
But it can be done.
但还是可以做到

895
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:59,180
And I'll have to look up how to do it.
所以我将会去改善这种处理方式

896
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:00,348
All right.
总而言之

897
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,515
So the last two things I'm gonna talk about is
我接下去会讲的最后2个概念

898
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:02,549
the File System and Core Data.
就是File System和Core Data

899
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,684
So the File System is very simple, okay.
首先File System是非常简单的

900
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:09,288
Your device, your iOS device, has a Unix filesystem.
你的设备，只要是使用iOS系统的设备，都有一个基于Unix内核的文件系统

901
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:13,458
Okay, because I told you the very first day of this class,
因为我在我们第一天的课上就告诉过你们

902
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,961
basically Unix is underlying a variant of Unix,
基本上MAC系统、BSD Unix系统都是

903
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:19,497
BSD, Mac is underneath all of iOS,
都是基于Unix内核的变种

904
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:22,767
it's providing the kinda core OS services.
它提供了部分core OS services层上的服务

905
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:24,068
So you have the Unix filesystem there.
所以你的文件系统是基于Unix内核的

906
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,336
And if you want to store things in the File System,
然后如果你想要使用File Systm来存储数据

907
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:28,405
you just store them in this Unix filesystem.
你就是将数据存储到你的Unix系统的文件系统中

908
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:31,374
Now, kinda four steps to do that.
那么现在你需要做4步来实现这个操作

909
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:35,144
One is you have to get the root path, it's true,
首先，你需要有个根路径

910
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:38,447
some URL, file system URL, not HTTP URL,
你将要把文件写入或是读取的路径

911
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:42,250
that you're going to write or read from, okay.
这个路径是基于文件系统的URL，不是类似于HTTP请求的URL

912
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:45,053
So, you basically got to start somewhere in the File System.
所以，你基本上就是把文件存在文件系统的某个地方

913
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,889
Now, it's a Unix filesystem, of course it starts at slash,
现在，这个一个基于Unix内核的文件系用，当然你将从某个斜线(../)开始

914
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,290
but you can't write in slash,
但是你不能将文件写入这个斜线下

915
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,258
that's the, you know, root directory.
因为你应该知道的，斜线是从根目录开始的

916
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,460
You have to write somewhere down, slash, slash something,
你不得不写在从你开始的地方的目录

917
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:54,794
slash something, slash something,
斜线之后的某个斜线下

918
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:55,962
that's where you get to start.
类似于../../../

919
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:58,431
So finding that root path is the first step and
所以首先设定好根路径是第一步

920
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,165
we'll show you how to do that.
我会向你展示这是怎么做的

921
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:03,969
Then you're gonna append the path components onto that URL.
接下来你就会发现这个URL是由文件路径组成的

922
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:07,739
So, if you want to create some directories in that place and
所以，如果你想要先创建某个目录再在目录下存储文件

923
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:11,042
then some files, you're gonna be using appends and
你需要使用append方法将路径

924
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:13,210
NSURL has some methods to do that.
转换成NSUrl形式

925
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:16,714
And then you're going to read and write files from that URL.
然后你就可以通过这个URL读取或是写入这个文件

926
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:18,148
And we'll talk about how you do that.
当然我们会谈论关于怎样来实现

927
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,417
And finally, you're gonna manage the filesystem.
最后，你也可以管理这个文件系统

928
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:23,920
You might wanna remove a file, you might wanna rename a file,
比如你想要删除文件，或是重命名一个文件

929
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,922
you might wanna see what files are in a directory, and
你也可以看在目录下的文件是什么格式的

930
00:38:26,924 --> 00:38:29,892
that's all done with this class, NSFileManager.
这些操作都可以通过NSFileManager这个类来实现

931
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:31,226
Okay.
知道了吗？

932
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,144
So that's it.
所以这个就是

933
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:33,061
This is how the File System works.
关于File System是怎样运作的

934
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,763
So let's look into all of these steps.
让我们回顾一下这整个过程

935
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:38,432
So you see this File System, it starts at root.
我们来看这个文件系统， 它以根目录(/)开始

936
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:40,768
It's a protected file system, though, so
它是一个被保护的文件系统，所以

937
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,470
you can't see most of the stuff that's in root, or
在根目录下的大部分东西你看不到，

938
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:45,805
any of the system directories or whatever.
包括系统目录以及一些别的。

939
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:48,775
It's not readable by you.
你无法读取。

940
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:52,578
So, there is a part of the Unix filesystem there, though,
但是有一部分 Unix 文件系统，

941
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,582
that is your application's own, it's called its sandbox.
是你的应用拥有的，叫做它的沙盒(sandbox)

942
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,550
Okay, and this is the only place you can write.
好了，这就是你唯一可以写入的地方。

943
00:38:58,552 --> 00:39:01,453
Some of the places in your own sandbox, you can't even write.
即使是在沙盒里面，有些位置你也不允许写入。

944
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:03,721
Like the place where your actual application is,
比如存放应用自身的地方。

945
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,640
you can't write there.
那里你无法写入。

946
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,558
So you can't modify [LAUGH] your own code by writing
所以你无法通过修改应用存放的目录

947
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,960
something in that directory or something.
来改动你的(二进制)代码

948
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:12,162
Okay, but many of the directories,
Okay，但是沙盒里的很多目录，

949
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:15,298
subdirectories of your sandbox, you can write in.
子目录，都允许写入。

950
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,633
So this is the place where you can write, and
这就是你可以写入的地方，

951
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:19,835
you can read everything in your sandbox.
而且你可以读取沙盒里面的所有内容。

952
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:23,072
Then we'll talk about how you get a URL into your sandbox in
后面我们讨论如何拿到连接到沙盒内部的一个 URL ，

953
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:24,540
a second.
稍等一下。

954
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,007
Now, why do we do this sandboxing thing?
现在，为什么我们要做这样的沙盒模型呢？

955
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,909
For obvious reasons, for security.
明显的理由是为了安全。

956
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:30,511
You don't want to be able to look into other apps and
你不想能够看到别人的 App，

957
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:33,280
see what's going on over there, and you don't want to
能够看到那里发生了什么；你不想能够

958
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:35,516
be able to access the system directories and
访问系统目录并且

959
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:36,616
mess up that iPhone.
把 iPhone 搞崩溃。

960
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:39,152
So it's completely obvious, but there's one
这显而易见，但沙盒还存在

961
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:41,721
slightly non-obvious reason to this sandbox,
一个不那么显而易见的理由，

962
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:44,590
is that since everything you are ever going to write on
既然你能写入的位置

963
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,425
the local disk is in this sandbox.
被限制在本地存储的沙盒里，

964
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:50,895
If the user deletes your app you know, they go over here
那么如果用户删除了你的应用，他们来这

965
00:39:50,897 --> 00:39:55,199
and hold down until the thing, it's the other one.
长摁直到发生一件事。

966
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:56,333
Which one are we showing?
我们显示的是什么(切换投影显示iPad)

967
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,100
Yeah, this one.
嗯，这个。

968
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:58,468
See them wiggling there?
看到它们左右摇晃没？

969
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,504
So, if they hold down wiggle, if they were to press x to
所以应用图标长摁开始摇晃后，如果点击叉叉

970
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:04,273
delete it, it would delete your entire sandbox.
删掉它，这将会删除整个沙盒。

971
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,542
So everything you've ever written is gone.
于是你写入的所有东西都没了。

972
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:07,542
Okay?

973
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:09,077
Also, that's true for backup.
这对于备份也是一样。

974
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,246
If they backup their phone to iTunes U, okay, or
如果用户把他们的手机备份到 iTunes U (口误)

975
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:15,416
iTunes and iTunes U, iTunes, then it would back
备份到 iTunes， 那将会

976
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:19,252
up certain directories in your Sandbox, not all of them.
把沙盒里面的特定目录备份，不是所有的目录。

977
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:20,320
Okay?

978
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:22,889
So, that's another reason to have this Sandbox.
所以，这就是使用沙盒的另一个原因。

979
00:40:22,891 --> 00:40:23,689
So, what's in there?
那么，那里有什么？

980
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:24,990
What's in the Sandbox?
沙盒里有什么？

981
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:27,726
There's various bundles, which are directories.
那里有各种包 (bundle)，以目录形式存在。

982
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:29,961
There's the application bundle I talked about,
有我刚提到的应用包，

983
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,829
that's where your actual app is, okay?
它就是你的应用的实体，okay？

984
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,431
And everything there is read-only.
里面所有的内容都是只读的。

985
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,832
All your storyboards in there.
你所有的 storyboard 都在里面。

986
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,900
If you have JPEGs that are in your image assets,
你的 image assets 里的 jpg 文件，

987
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:37,967
they're all in there.
也在里面。

988
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,168
They're all read-only.
统统只读。

989
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,971
If you put something in there you needed to edit,
如果你想要在里面放置一些需要编辑的东西，

990
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,739
like maybe some SQL database or
比如数据库文件或者

991
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,341
something you put in there or some data file.
别的数据文件，

992
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,943
You would have to copy it out of the application bundle into
你必须把它从应用包里面复制出来，

993
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,279
one of these other directories in your Sandbox, and
放到沙盒里的一个子目录里面，

994
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:52,646
then you could edit it there.
然后再去编辑它。

995
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:54,565
Okay?

996
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:56,483
So, you can ship your app with things you're gonna edit, but
这样你就带着你的 App 和将要修改的部分一同发布了，

997
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:59,553
you just have to copy them out of your application directory.
但是你必须把它复制到应用目录外面去。

998
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:01,187
And then, there's also other directories in there.
当然，那里还存在别的目录。

999
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:04,223
The documents directory, that's where you should store
Documents 目录，这里是存放

1000
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:06,659
what the user perceives as their data, okay?
用户数据的地方。

1001
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:09,461
The things they're creating and editing and
用户创建编辑并且拥有的数据，

1002
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:12,531
owning that they expect to be there all the time.
最好一直都在这个目录下。

1003
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,399
Even if you don't, kind of,
即使你没有，

1004
00:41:14,401 --> 00:41:17,735
divide it up into a document in your UI, it's still,
从你的 UI 里分离出一个文档，它依然存在。

1005
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:20,671
that's what the documents directory is for.
这就是 Documents 目录的作用。

1006
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:22,406
There's also a caches directory.
缓存目录。

1007
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:25,442
This is for data that you could throw away.
这是存放那些可以被丢弃的数据的地方。

1008
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:26,976
So, it's some information you got from
假设你从互联网上下载了一些数据，

1009
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:29,112
the Internet that you can go back to the Internet, but,
你可以再次访问互联网去下载，但是，

1010
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,313
it might be slow to go to the Internet, so you're going to
再次联网可能会比较慢，所以你希望

1011
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:33,215
keep a local copy, but, you could throw it away.
保留一个本地副本，但是，你可以把它丢弃掉。

1012
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:35,917
That directory, for example, wouldn't get backed up

1013
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:38,520
to iTunes, okay, if someone plugged their phone in,

1014
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:40,888
because they figure you can recreate it, okay?

there's about a dozen different directories.
各种不同的目录。

1017
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:47,728
And, you find all these directories by looking
你可以在文档中查到所有的目录，

1018
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,231
in the documentation for the term NSSearchPathDirectory.
搜索术语 NSSearchPathDirectory 就行。

1019
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,517

1020
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:56,802
And, I'll talk about that in a second as well.
我过一会儿再讨论这个。

1021
00:41:56,804 --> 00:42:00,772
So, how do you get the URL to these special

1022
00:42:00,774 --> 00:42:03,742
directories in your Sandbox?

1023
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:05,910
You do it with this file manager class,

1024
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:07,178
this NSFileManager.
也就是 NSFileManager.

1025
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,481
Now, NSFileManager, there's actually a class

1029
00:42:19,657 --> 00:42:21,557
NSFileManager is thread safe.

1031
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:26,161
write a very large file in a different thread.
在不同的线程里读写同一个大文件。

1032
00:42:26,163 --> 00:42:27,946

1037
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:38,872
instance in one thread and then use it in another one.
然后在另一个线程里使用它。

1038
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:40,440
That's not thread safe.
这就不再线程安全了。

1039
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:42,008
Okay?

1040
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,575
But, even if you're accessing the same files,

00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,948
as long as each thread has its own NSFileManager.
只要每个线程使用它自己的 NSFileManager。

1044
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,551
So the NSFileManager DefaultFileManager,

1045
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,886
you'll see that in the documentation.
你可以查看相关文档。

1046
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,822
That one is kind of your main thread, DefaultFileManager.
DefaultFileManager 在主线程。

1047
00:42:57,824 --> 00:43:00,224
If you're only gonna use it on the main queue,

1048
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:01,592
then you can use that one.
你可以使用 DefaultFileManager。

1049
00:43:01,594 --> 00:43:02,893
Otherwise, just create an instance.
否则，创建一个实例。

1050
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:05,095
It's pretty light-weight to create an instance of

NSFileManager just like this, okay,
就像这样。

1052
00:43:06,765 --> 00:43:08,698
let fileManager equal NSFileManager().
let fileManager = NSFileManager()

1053
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,700
So, once you have a file manager, then you can send it

1054
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:14,302
this message, URLsForDirectory inDomain.

1072
00:43:57,242 --> 00:43:59,675
So, don't be freaked out by the fact that this returns

1076
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:10,585
directory like the documents directory, or

1083
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,866
NSCachesDirectory, NSDocumentationDirectory.
NSCachesDirectory, NSDocumentationDirectory.

1084
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:30,702
By the way, be careful with NSDocumentationDirectory
顺便提一句， 小心 NSDocumentationDirectory 跟

1085
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,337
versus NSDocumentsDirectory.
NSDocumentsDirectory 的区别。

1086
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,573
I can't tell you how many final projects people post in

1087
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:39,076
Piazza, and they'll say, I've been trying to write to my

1088
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:42,513
NSDocumentsDirectory for days but it says not writable.

1093
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,123
NSDocuments is the writeable one,

00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,558
okay, NSDocumentation is documentation.
NSDocumentation 是文档。

1095
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,193
All right?

1096
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,461
So, now you have the URL to the root of one of these

1097
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:02,496
things, like the document's directory,

1100
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:09,302
Well, you're going to use URLs, NSURLs methods,
你可以使用 URL， NSURL 的方法，

1101
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:11,804
URLByAppendingPathComponent, or

URLByAppendingPathExtension.
URLByAppendingPathExtension.

1103
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:18,810
Some extensions like .jpg, or whatever, .doc,

1104
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:22,313
got some document format of some sort.
拿到一些文档格式信息。

1105
00:45:22,315 --> 00:45:23,981
And so, that's how you're gonna do that.
这就是你处理的方法。

1106
00:45:23,983 --> 00:45:26,550
And, by appending multiple path components,
并且， 后面补上多个 path component(目录名外加目录分隔符)，

1107
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:29,353
you can build things inside directories, right?
你就可以在目录里面创建东西。

1108
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:33,056
So I can say a path component, today's documents.
比如今天讨论的 path componet， documents.

1109
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:37,060
And then path component foo, and that would be a directory,
然后再来个 path componet foo， 这会是个目录，

1110
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:40,129
today's documents, and inside foo, okay?
先是 documents， 然后在 foo 的里面。

1111
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:41,530
So that's how you build up the URL.
所以这就是创建一个 URL 的方法。

1112
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:44,866
So, once you have a URL, you can find out some things,
一旦你拥有了一个URL, 你可以发现一些事情，

1113
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:47,702
like, about it, like, is this a file URL, or

1116
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:54,141
an image, and you wanna know whether it's on disk or
在你访问一个图片时，你想要确定它是在本地磁盘上，

1117
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:55,542
whether it's on the network,
还是在远程网络上。

1118
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,976
you might put one in the thread.
你可以把它放在线程里面。

1119
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:58,862
Cuz some people ask,
因为有些人问，

1120
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:00,747
should I always access my file system in the thread?
我是不是应该把访问文件系统的代码都放在线程里？

1121
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:02,515
And the answer is, probably for
答案是，可能

1122
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:06,051
small files unless they're, you know, megabyte size files.
对于那些好多MB的大文件需要，小文件不需要。

1123
00:46:06,053 --> 00:46:08,353
You're probably fine to access them in the main queue.
你在 main queue 里访问这些小文件可能没什么问题。

1124
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:10,021
It's pretty fast, that flash memory,
在闪存里速度相当快，

1125
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:11,956
pretty quick at getting the information back.
很快就拿回数据，

1126
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,924
You probably don't need to do that.
你可能不需要做更多的事情。

1127
00:46:13,926 --> 00:46:16,760
It couldn't hurt, especially, if you already have

1128
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:19,496
the code to deal with the fact that file might be over
处理可能存在远程网络的文件的代码，

1129
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:22,599
the network, might as well do it for the local file, too.
同时也用它来处理本地文件。

1130
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:25,468
There is also a very important method that's a little bit
有个比较重要的方法被掩盖在

1131
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,604
buried in the documentation called resourceValuesForKeys.
文档之中，叫做 resourceValuesForKeys。

1132
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:30,773
This is how you get things like,
这是你用于获取类似

1133
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:33,108
when was this file last accessed?
这个文件最后的访问时间的方法。

1134
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,443

00:46:34,444 --> 00:46:35,777
How big is this file in bytes, 'kay?
也可以获取以byte为单位，文件的大小信息。

1136
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:39,681
That's this NSURL thing, resourceValuesForKeys.
这就是 NSURL 的 resourceValuesForKeys 方法的作用。

1137
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:43,150
When you give it the keys, like files last change date or
当你指定了类型， 比如文件最后修改日期或者别的

1138
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:46,553
whatever, and it's going to return in a dictionary,
相关信息会在返回的字典里提供，

1139
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:49,756
rather, with those keys you gave and the values for
进一步的，指定更多的类型则返回所有的

1140
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:51,458
all those things, 'kay?
相关信息。

1141
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,792
Permissions, all that stuff.
权限信息啦，等等。

1142
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:56,062
resourceValuesForKeys.

1143
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,030
All right, now, I've got a URL,
现在我有了一个 URL，

1144
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:00,132
I want to write to the file system.

1145
00:47:00,134 --> 00:47:03,801
How do I write something to the file system given the URL?
这种情况下我如何把一些内容写入文件系统？

1146
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:05,503
And the answer is usually,
答案通常是，

1147
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:07,738
you're going to use NSData, okay?
你要使用NSData，okay？

1148
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,574
Might use the property list ones, like NSArray and
也可以使用 property list 支持的类型， 比如 NSArray 跟

1149
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:13,343
NSDictionary and write a property list out to it.
NSDictionary 然后输出一个 property list 文件。

1150
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:16,412
But you oftentimes can use NSData, cuz you have some
不过你时常得使用NSData， 因为你有一些图像数据或者

1151
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:19,415
image data or some other data you want to write out,
其他类型的数据想要输出，

1152
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:21,016
sound files, something.
比如声音文件，等等。

1153
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:24,619
And so, you do that with NSData's method writeToURL,
所以， 你只要调用 NSData 的方法，

1154
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:26,171
atomically.
writeToURL(NSURL, automically: Bool)

1155
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:27,722
And so, writeToURL, you just give it a URL.
这样， writeToURL, 你只要提供一个 URL。

1156
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:30,157
It will write that file out there.
它就能把文件写到那里去。

1157
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:34,061
And the atomically means, write a temporary file,
atomically 参数的意思是，先写一个临时文件，

1158
00:47:34,063 --> 00:47:36,730
and then, remove the old file, and
然后删掉老的文件，

1159
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:39,866
put the new one in an atomic transaction.
再将新的临时文件移过去，整个过程保持原子级。

1160
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:41,401
Okay?

1161
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:42,935
That way, if something happens in the middle of writing
这样，如果在写文件的过程种发生了什么，

00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:44,903
the file, the file won't be half written.
文件不会是个半成品。

1163
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,872

1241
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:36,384
Okay and then coordinator provides a way to have these

1256
00:51:15,454 --> 00:51:16,953
graphically there.
来创建 schema。

1394
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,739
into by doing this in NSData.
为 NSData 格式。

1395
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,275
So this is going to return in NSData.

00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,513
So, it's gonna turn our image into NSData.
所以，它会把我们的图片转为 NSData。

1398
00:57:33,515 --> 00:57:36,315
It's kinda the opposite of NSData contents for URL,

This goes back the other way for JPG.
这个把 JPG 转换回去了。

1402
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:46,224
So, if we're able to do that conversion, then I'm
所以，如果我们能做这个转换， 我要

1403
00:57:46,226 --> 00:57:48,860
gonna get the fileManager here as a local variable.
在这里以 fileManager 为局部变量。

1404
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:51,962
I could just constantly, I could use the defaultManager

by defaultManager you see I'm in the main thread.
使用 defaultManager 你明白我在主线程里。

1406
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:57,701
But just in case I ever put this in a separate thread or

1407
00:57:57,703 --> 00:58:01,004
something, I'll go ahead and use an instance of it here.
我要在这里使用它的一个实例。

1408

So now I need to get the documents directory,
这里我需要拿到 Documents 目录，

1409
00:58:03,174 --> 00:58:04,940
because these waypoints, really

1410
00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:07,276
the user perceives them as their document data.
用户的存档数据。

1416
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:18,719
the photo library.
相片库。

1417
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:21,221
But I'm just trying to demo here how to do the file

1418
00:58:21,223 --> 00:58:23,489
system, so that's why we're doing that.
所以这就是我们的处理方式。

1419
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:26,392
So, I'm gonna get the documents directory and

1420
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:28,994
so here's a nice long line of code for you.

There we go.
我们继续。

1437
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:18,304
Okay?

1438
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,039
So this will end up being a NSURL that
所以这里最后得到一个 NSURL，

1439
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:25,677
points to the DocumentDirectory.
指向存档目录。

1440
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:27,145
Okay?

1441
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,612
So now I have a DocumentDirectory,
现在我有了存档目录，

1442
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:31,715
I need a unique name for this photo that I just took.
我需要对我刚拍的照片取个唯一的名字。

1443
00:59:31,717 --> 00:59:34,951
So, I'm gonna create that by just saying,
我这么实现：

1444
00:59:34,953 --> 00:59:38,655
NSDate.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate
NSDate.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate

1445
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:40,590
So this is just a certain number of seconds.

1446
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:42,892
This is just a unique number.

00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:44,193
It's gonna be a double.
double 类型。

1448
00:59:44,195 --> 00:59:47,896
That unique identifies this photo, because it can't have
这个唯一确认了这张图， 因为你不可能

1449
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:50,765
two photos taken at the same instance in time.
用同一实例及时地拍两张照片。

1450
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:52,200
So we got that.
所以我们搞定了。

1451
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:54,886
And then so
然后

1452
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,571
I'm gonna let the URL for my photo be the docsDir and then
我要设定我的照片的 URL 为 docsDir 调用

1453
00:59:57,573 --> 01:00:02,642
URLByAppendingPathComponent and then I'm just gonna create
URLByAppendingPathComponent 方法， 我用

1454
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:07,347
a string out of that unique and we'll say that it's a jpg.
这个唯一数字创建字符串，外加 jpg 扩展名作为参数补在后面。

1455
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:08,147
Okay?

1456
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:10,582
So now I've created a URL,
现在我创建了一个 URL，

1457
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:15,320
which is just this unique string with JPG on the end.
就是这个唯一字符串，以 jpg 结尾的。

1458
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:17,722
So now, if I can get the path to that URL.
所以如果我能拿到 URL 指向的路径。

1459
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:19,557
So this is gonna take the URL and

1460
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,325
turn it into a string, okay?
成一个字符串，okay？

1461
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,293
Cuz URLs are in this URL objects.

1462
01:00:23,295 --> 01:00:25,562
I want the string, you'll see why in a second here.
我需要的是字符串， 你们马上会看到为什么会这样。

1463
01:00:25,564 --> 01:00:29,432
If I can get that, then I'm gonna take that imageData and
如果能够拿到，我就用 imageData

1464
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:33,435
write it out to that URL and I'm gonna do it atomically.
向着 URL 输出且要求这是原子级操作。

1465
01:00:33,437 --> 01:00:34,386
Okay?

1466

So the last thing is Embed Segues.
最后的内容是 Embed Segues

1519
01:03:08,003 --> 01:03:11,504
So, Embed Segues is just taking the view,
Embed Segues 总是将一个 view，

1520
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:14,273
self.view, basically of an MVC and

1524
01:03:20,915 --> 01:03:24,049
It's a pretty powerful encapsulation technique.

The way you do it is really easy.
使用它非常简单。

1526
01:03:25,585 --> 01:03:27,519
In the storyboard,

1533
01:03:37,195 --> 01:03:39,028
That little grey thing's the container,

1535
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:44,033
And then that little arrow there moving,

1536
01:03:44,035 --> 01:03:45,701
that's the Embed Segue.
就是 Embed Segue。

1537
01:03:45,703 --> 01:03:48,603
And you can see there's another MVC there and that MVC

is the one who's self.view is gonna be embedded.
的 self.view 要被内嵌。

1539
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:53,825
All right?

1540
01:03:53,826 --> 01:03:56,243
The timing of this, you've got to be a little careful on
在它的过程里， 你要小心

1541
01:03:56,245 --> 01:03:59,113
prepareForSegue, because this embed all
prepareForSegue, 因为这个内嵌都

1542
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:02,182
happens before any outlets are set as usual.
发生在任何 outlets 被正常设置好之前。

1543
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:03,850
And so, it's happening very, very early in the game.
而且，它发生的非常非常早。

1544
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:06,586
So, usually in our Embed Segue,
所以通常在 Embed Segue 里，

1545
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:09,422
what we do is we grab onto that MVC.
我们要做的就是抓住那个 MVC。

1546
01:04:09,424 --> 01:04:12,057
Okay, so that we have a handle to it.

1547
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:14,426
We can talk to it.
我们可以跟它交流。

01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:16,794
We can prepare it, set it up, whatever want later.
我们可以为它准备， 把它装配好，之后任何想做的。

1549
01:04:16,797 --> 01:04:20,198
So this is best shown by just demonstrating it so

1550
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,735
I'm gonna demonstrate that by going to Trax.

1553
01:04:34,513 --> 01:04:37,780
And when we click on the left edge of a call out,

And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna embed in the corner,
我要做的，是在这个角落，

1557
01:04:49,026 --> 01:04:53,327
a little rectangle down here, a little square that contains

1558
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:57,098
a little map view, with just the pin for this image.
里面包含一小块 map view 和这张图片对应的大头针。

1559
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,266
So that when I'm look in the image,
所以当我查看图片时，

1560
01:04:59,268 --> 01:05:02,502
especially on the iPad where I've got a big screen,

1568
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:20,218
view controller is we need to do this segue, and
我们需要处理这个 segue，

1569
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,820
we need this view controller right here to have

you can see that its class is ImageViewController.
你能看到它的类型是 ImageViewController。

1575
01:05:32,464 --> 01:05:33,763
So I need to change this.

1577
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:38,233
controller.

1580
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:42,770
a subclass of ImageViewController.
ImageViewController 的子类。

1581
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,538
So it's gonna do everything this one does.
所以它可以做父类能做的一切事情。

1582
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:48,809
Plus it's gonna know about how to manage that embed.
外加如何处理内嵌。

1583
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:49,509
Okay?

1584
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:52,111
So let's create a new class.
我们创建一个新类。

1585
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:53,746
All right, the Cocoa Touch Class.
选择 Cocoa Touch Class.

1586
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:57,282
It's gonna be a subclass of ImageViewController,
它是我们的 ImageViewController，

1587
01:05:57,284 --> 01:05:58,650
one of our classes.
的子类。

1588
01:05:58,652 --> 01:06:03,388
And I'm gonna call it WaypointImageViewController.
我把它命名为 WaypointImageViewController。

1589
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,388
Okay.

1590
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,357
Put it in the standard place.
把它放置在标准位置。

1591
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:09,192
'Kay here it is, here's our WaypointImageViewController.
好了， 这就是我们的 WaypointImageViewController。

1592
01:06:09,194 --> 01:06:11,861
This WaypointImageViewController,
这个 WaypointImageViewController，

1593
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:13,730
its model is the waypoint.
它的 model 是 waypoint

1594
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:15,215
'Kay?

1595
01:06:15,216 --> 01:06:16,699
This guy's model, did everyone remember what
这家伙的 model，大家都记得

1596
01:06:16,701 --> 01:06:18,367
ImageViewController's model is?
ImageViewController 的 model 是什么吗？

1597
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:19,968
It's just an image URL.
它只是个图片 URL。

1598
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,853
Right?

1599
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:23,737
So we need a little more powerful model here in our
这里我们需要一个更强大的 model，

1600
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,107
WaypointImageViewCcontroller, so
在 WaypointImageViewController 里，

1601
01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:28,442
I'm just going to have var waypoint.
所以我定义变量 waypoint。

1602
01:06:28,444 --> 01:06:30,310
It's a GPX Waypoint.
它是 GPX Waypoint 格式的。

1603
01:06:30,312 --> 01:06:33,046
It'll work with the editable ones or non-editable ones.
它可以支持可编辑的和不可编辑的。

1604
01:06:33,048 --> 01:06:35,415
And when that waypoint is set,
在 waypoint 变量被设置时，

1605
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:39,418
I want to make sure that I set my super classes model.
我要确保父类的 model 也被更新。

1606
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,989
So, I'm gonna say my imageURL equals that
我在这里输入

1607
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:46,691
waypoint's imageURL.
imageURL = waypoint?.imageURL

1608
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:47,291
Okay?

1609
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:50,044
So, here,
在这里，

1610
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:52,796
I'm basically setting my super class's URL there.
基本上我设置了父类的 URL。

1611
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:57,701
And what are we getting this about here?
这里的错误提示是什么原因？

1612
01:06:57,703 --> 01:06:59,736
Oh, okay, we're not there, okay.
哦，没什么问题。

1613
01:06:59,738 --> 01:07:03,272
And then I'm also gonna set my title equal to the waypoint's
然后我也要把 title 设置为 waypoint 的

1614
01:07:03,274 --> 01:07:04,606
name, might as well.
名字， 顺便。

1615
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:08,677
And then I'm just gonna update my embedded map, okay, because
然后我要更新我的内嵌的地图，okay，因为

1616
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:12,147
the whole point of this guy is he has this embedded map.
这个 view controller 的重点就在于它持有内嵌的地图。

1617
01:07:12,149 --> 01:07:16,183
So, we'll have a function here called updateEmbeddedMap, and
所以我们在这里实现名为 updateEmbeddedMap 的函数，

1618
01:07:16,185 --> 01:07:18,185
it's going to update that map.
这个函数会更新地图。

1619
01:07:18,187 --> 01:07:21,088
And we'll talk about how that's going to happen
我们过一会儿再讨论

1620
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,322
a little bit later.
具体实现。

1621
01:07:22,324 --> 01:07:25,792
This isn't optional, that's why, okay.
这不是 optional， 这就是原因， okay。

1622
01:07:25,794 --> 01:07:27,026
All right, so that's it.
就是这样。

1623
01:07:27,028 --> 01:07:29,695
So that's our waypoint image controller,
这就是我们的 WaypointImageViewController,

1624
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:31,163
kind of its main thing.
它的主要的事情。

1625
01:07:31,165 --> 01:07:33,865
So now we need to go back to our storyboard, and
我们需要返回到 storyboard，

1626
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:37,168
I'm gonna make this image view controller right here be
我要把这里的 ImageViewController

1627
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,270
a waypoint image view controller.
换成 WaypointImageViewController.

1628
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:41,638
So I'm just gonna go here to its identity and
我们来这里查找它的ID，

1629
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,108
go down here and say now it's a WaypointImageViewController.
往下翻，好了，它是个 WaypointImageViewController。

1630
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:47,444
Also, I'm gonna fix this segue.
同样，我要处理这个 segue。

1631
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:49,278
This is a segue from our map view.
这是一个来自 map view 的 segue。

1632
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,016
I'm gonna just fix this one to prepare this guy by giving
我要在 prepare 函数里，

1633
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:55,350
his way point.
提供它的 waypoint 来解决问题。

1634
01:07:55,352 --> 01:07:59,020
So that's over here in our GPXViewController,
我们到 GPXViewController 里，

1635
01:07:59,022 --> 01:08:00,721
down here in prepare.
跳到 prepare 函数里。

1636
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:02,890
Okay, here's where we're preparing
Okay， 这是我们准备

1637
01:08:02,892 --> 01:08:04,491
the ImageViewController.
ImageViewController 的地方。

1638
01:08:04,493 --> 01:08:05,258
Okay?

1639
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,959
So here I'm going to say,
在这里我要输入

1640
01:08:06,961 --> 01:08:10,363
if I can let the waypoint image view controller equal
if let wivc =

1641
01:08:10,365 --> 01:08:12,998
the segue destinationViewController,
segue.destinationViewController

1642
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,735
contentViewController as a waypoint view controller.
.contentViewController as? WaypointImageViewController。

1643
01:08:16,737 --> 01:08:19,771
So in other words if it's a waypoint image controller,
还句话说，它确实是 WaypointImageViewController 类型,

1644
01:08:19,773 --> 01:08:23,107
then I'm gonna say waypoint image view controller waypoint
那么我要把它的 waypoint 变量 

1645
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:24,275
equals my waypoint.
赋值为这里的 waypoint。

1646
01:08:24,277 --> 01:08:26,010
And actually I'll just go ahead and
实际上我会继续执行，并且

1647
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:27,978
leave this other code in here as an else.
把原先的代码作为 else 分支。

1648
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,246
Else if it's not a waypoint view image controller,
如果它不是 WaypointImageViewController，

1649
01:08:30,248 --> 01:08:32,148
it's just a normal image view controller,
它只是个普通的 ImageViewController，

1650
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,749
we'll still make that work as well.
我们也要让它正常工作。

1651
01:08:33,751 --> 01:08:36,552
But we could delete this code, and it would work fine now.
不过我们可以删除这段代码， 删除后也能工作正常。

1652
01:08:36,554 --> 01:08:41,489
But I'll just leave it in there, just for reference.
我还是留着它，作为参考。

1653
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:43,791
Okay.

1654
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:46,092
So now we need to go do this embedding business.
现在我们需要去处理内嵌事务。

1655
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:47,673
Okay.

1656
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:49,252
We need to put this thing in here.
我们需要把这个放到这里。

1657
01:08:49,253 --> 01:08:50,831
Now one thing I'm gonna advise you to do, when you're doing
现在我要给你们一个建议，当你在实现

1658
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:53,266
embedding, and kind of be a little careful of.
内嵌时，要稍微留意的事情，

1659
01:08:53,268 --> 01:08:55,802
Is when you drag out this Container View,
是当你拽出这个 container view，

1660
01:08:55,804 --> 01:08:59,472
which is at the very bottom, by the way, it's gonna want to
顺便说一句，它在最底下，它会成为

1661
01:08:59,474 --> 01:09:02,508
be a subview of the thing you're dragging it on.
你放下它时碰到的控件的 subview。

1662
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:05,444
So it keeps trying here to be a subview of that scroll view,
所以在这里放下会成为那个 scroll view 的 subview，

1663
01:09:05,446 --> 01:09:08,046
and I don't want it to be a subview, a scroll view,
不过我不希望它变成 scroll view 的 subview,

1664
01:09:08,048 --> 01:09:09,647
because I want it to sit on top.
因为我想让它呆在顶层。

1665
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,049
Okay, I want it to always be there, and
Okay，我希望它在那里一直不动，

1666
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:12,516
the scroll view is scrolling behind it.
scroll view 则在它后面滚动。

1667
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:15,119
I don't want it to be in there scrolling around.
我不希望它被滑走。

1668
01:09:15,121 --> 01:09:17,388
Okay?

1669
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:19,656
So it's really a bit of a pain to do that with this in way.
所以这样做确实有点麻烦。

1670
01:09:19,658 --> 01:09:22,559
So you can just take something like your scroll view, for
所以你可以把那个控件，比如说这个 srollView，

1671
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:25,094
example, and move it out of the way temporarily.
临时先挪走。

1672
01:09:25,096 --> 01:09:26,796
So I just moved it out of the way.
所以我把它挪开了。

1673
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:29,298
So now I can put my Container View in here.
现在我可以把我的 container view 放在这里。

1674
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,833
I can put it where I want, probably not
我可以把它放在任何位置，可能不是

1675
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:35,070
in the very corner there, something like that.
紧贴着这个角，类似这样。

1676
01:09:35,072 --> 01:09:41,042
I can do all my auto layout here.
我可以在这里设置 autoLayout。

1677
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:44,178
Maybe we'll do this a little, do it higher, yeah,
我们可以在这里调整一下，高一点儿，耶，

1678
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,113
let's do that, bottom space.
设置一下，底边距。

1679
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:50,983
Probably, I want this container to be a fixed width
大概，我希望这个 container view 有固定的

1680
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:52,952
and height, okay.
宽高。

1681
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:54,787
I don't know what width and height I would want.
我不知道我想要的宽高值。

1682
01:09:54,789 --> 01:10:00,158
Maybe like, I don't know, let's say 200
可能是，我不知道，先假设是 200

1683
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:05,296
by 200, sorry, double-click there.
x 200， 抱歉， 双击那里。

1684
01:10:05,298 --> 01:10:06,563
So let's make it 200 by 200.
让我们设置它为 200 x 200 的大小。

1685
01:10:06,565 --> 01:10:10,633
We could make it whatever size we thought was kind of most
我们可以把它设置为任何大小，

1686
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:12,802
appropriate for this space.
只要我们认为在这里尺寸合适。

1687
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:15,571
And then we could put this back, this scroll view back.
然后我们把它放回去，把 scroll view 恢复回来。

1688
01:10:15,573 --> 01:10:18,407
By the way, if you go over here to the document outline,
顺便说下， 如果你去 document outline 里看看，

1689
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:20,676
you can see the order in the view hierarchy.
你会发现 view 层级的顺序。

1690
01:10:20,678 --> 01:10:23,411
Like this would be behind, and
这样会在后面，

1691
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:26,681
this is in front of everything else.
这样是在最前面。

1692
01:10:26,683 --> 01:10:27,548
Okay.

1693
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,516
Scroll view the activity indicator and
顺序从后往前是 scroll view，activity indicator，

1694
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:30,717
this Container View.
container view。

1695
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,453
Now, I dragged this in here, but if we look oh,
现在，我把这个拽到了这里，但是如果我们仔细看，噢，

1696
01:10:33,455 --> 01:10:34,554
look at down here.
看下面这里。

1697
01:10:34,556 --> 01:10:35,621
What's this guy?
这是什么？

1698
01:10:35,623 --> 01:10:36,755
Okay.

1699
01:10:36,757 --> 01:10:41,593
See that is the little view controller that could.
这就是那个小小的 view controller。

1700
01:10:41,595 --> 01:10:44,228
This is the little view controller that is going to,
这是要跳转的小小的 view controller，

1701
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,163
whose self.view is gonna be in here.
他的 self.view 在这里。

1702
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:48,832
So let's do this guy right here, and we need a view
我们来实现它，我们需要给它定义一个

1703
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:51,968
controller class for this, so I'm going to create that.
view controller，我马上来创建。

1704
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:55,171
This is gonna be the world's simplest map view controller.
这会是世界上最简单的 map view controller.

1705
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:59,875
I'm gonna call it, in fact, SimpleMapViewController.
我干脆把它命名为 SimpleMapViewController。

1706
01:10:59,877 --> 01:11:02,111
It's gonna be a UIViewController.
它继承 UIViewController。

1707
01:11:02,113 --> 01:11:06,314
And all this SimpleMapViewController is
SimpleMapViewController 的所有任务

1708
01:11:06,316 --> 01:11:11,485
going to do is to make its map view outlet be public.
是把它的 map view 的 outlet 公开出来。

1709
01:11:11,487 --> 01:11:14,221
So that other people can do whatever the heck they want
这样别人就能够做他们想做的任何事情，

1710
01:11:14,223 --> 01:11:16,256
with the map view that's inside of it.
用里面的 map view。

1711
01:11:16,258 --> 01:11:18,591
So let's put a map view inside of it.
所以我们先 添加一个 map view。

1712
01:11:18,593 --> 01:11:19,892
Let's go back to our storyboard.
回到 storyboard。

1713
01:11:19,894 --> 01:11:22,661
Get this little guy right here.
拿到这里的这个小家伙。

1714
01:11:22,663 --> 01:11:25,164
Okay, I'm gonna, first of all I'm gonna make him be
首先我要把它变成

1715
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:27,165
a SimpleMapViewController, like that.
SimpleMapViewController，就像这样。

1716
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:31,069
And then I'm going to put a map view,
然后添加一个 map view。

1717
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,005
which is right here, inside of him.
放在这里，它的内部。

1718
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:36,139
Okay?

1719
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:37,974
Let's go ahead and go, suggested constraints.
我们继续，采用 suggested constraints。

1720
01:11:37,976 --> 01:11:40,843
Probably, that'll be just fine, yep,
大概这样就挺好的，

1721
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:42,345
all looks good to me.
一切看上去都很好。

1722
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:47,683
And so let's just create an outlet for that.
所以我们来创建它的 outlet。

1723
01:11:47,685 --> 01:11:51,419
Whoops, get an outlet here,
这里创建 outlet，

1724
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:55,923
small screen, there we go, okay.
屏幕太小，调到这里，okey。

1725
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:57,591
Whoops, SimpleMapViewController,
选择 SimpleMapViewController，

1726
01:11:57,593 --> 01:11:59,760
there it is.
好了。

1727
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:01,928
Let's Ctrl+drag here, mapView, 'kay?
我们 Ctrl+拖拽到这里， mapView， okey？

1728
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,563
So that's it.
搞定。

1729
01:12:03,564 --> 01:12:05,197
That's the entire implementation of this class.
这就是这个类的完整实现。

1730
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,365
It's just gonna do that.
这样就完成了。

1731
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:08,133
It does MapKit, so we have to.
它使用了 MapKit，我们需要声明。

1732
01:12:08,135 --> 01:12:13,304
Import MapKit, okay, so this just is public and
import MapKit，okay，这就把 map view 公开了，

1733
01:12:13,306 --> 01:12:17,575
we can do whatever we want with this map.
我们可以对它进行任何操作。

1734
01:12:17,577 --> 01:12:19,610
So, what do we want to do with this map?
那么，我们要对它干什么呢？

1735
01:12:19,612 --> 01:12:24,214
Well, we want this map to show our waypoint in our
我们用它来展示 waypoint，

1736
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:28,151
waypoint image view controller, okay?
WaypointImageViewController 里的 waypoint。

1737
01:12:28,153 --> 01:12:31,787
So, that's how we're gonna update this embedded map.
这就是我们在 updateEmbeddedMap 函数里要做的。

1738
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:34,456
We're, can access the map view directly.
我们直接访问这而过 mapView，

1739
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:37,626
But, the one thing we need to do, first,
不过，我们先要做的一件事，

1740
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:40,528
is we need to do this segue right here.
是我们需要在这里处理这个 segue。

1741
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,031
So, we need to give this segue an identifier.
我们需要给这个 segue 一个标识符。

1742
01:12:43,033 --> 01:12:47,334
We'll call it the Embed Map segue.
我们叫它 “Embed Map” segue。

1743
01:12:47,336 --> 01:12:51,237
And we need to prepare this segue.
我们需要为这个 segue 实现 prepare 函数。

1744
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:54,540
And we prepare it here.
我们在这里做实现。

1745
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:57,176
We're going to prepare it by just by grabbing that map
prepare 函数里只需要抓取

1746
01:12:57,178 --> 01:12:58,210
view, okay?
map view, okay?

1747
01:12:58,211 --> 01:12:59,243
Grabbing that controller, actually,
抓取那个 controller，

1748
01:12:59,246 --> 01:13:00,479
than grabbing the map view out of it.
然后抓取里面的 map view。

1749
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:03,281
So, I'm gonna prepare for segue here.
这里实现 prepareForSegue 函数。

1750
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:08,352
I'm gonna say, if the segue's identifier equals,
输入 if segue.identifier =

1751
01:13:08,354 --> 01:13:11,889
and we'll just, no constant here.
我们这里没有定义常量。

1752
01:13:11,891 --> 01:13:13,023
We should do one, but we're not gonna do.
我们应该这么处理，不过这次不做了。

1753
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:15,225
So, it's the embed segue.
所以，等于 “Embed Segue”

1754
01:13:15,227 --> 01:13:19,795
Then, actually, I'm just gonna create a var here,
然后，好吧，我要在这里创建一个变量，

1755
01:13:19,797 --> 01:13:24,333
which is the SMVC, the simple map view controller.
名字是 smvc， 意思是 SimpleMapViewController。

1756
01:13:24,335 --> 01:13:27,969
Which is a SimpleMapViewController,
SimpleMapViewController 类型，

1757
01:13:27,971 --> 01:13:30,538
optional.
optional 的。

1758
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,106
And, I'm just gonna actually set it inside this prepare for
我要在这个 prepareForSegue 函数里给它赋值，

1759
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:35,609
segue, so, smvc equals the segue's
所以，

1760
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:39,779
destinationViewController as a SimpleMapViewController.
smvc = segue.destinationViewController as? SimpleMapViewController

1761
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:41,747
So, in the set prepare for segue,
所以在这个函数里，

1762
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:45,117
I've just grabbed onto this SimpleMapViewController.
我抓取了一个 SimpleMapViewController。

1763
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,420
So, now that I have it, okay, let's go ahead and
我拿到了，okay，我们继续


1764
01:13:48,422 --> 01:13:52,090
update our embedded map here, and let's do the code for
在这里更新内嵌的地图，我们来实现

1765
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:53,758
doing the embedded map.
相关更新代码吧。

1766
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,825
Very simple.
非常简单。

1767
01:13:54,827 --> 01:13:57,094
I'm just gonna say,
我只要输入，

1768
01:13:57,096 --> 01:14:01,497
if I can get that map view out of that smvc.
如果我能拿到 smvc 的 map view。

1769
01:14:01,499 --> 01:14:09,371
Okay, then let's set the map view to be mapType Hybrid.
好了，那么我们就把 map view 的类型设置为 Hybrid。

1770
01:14:09,373 --> 01:14:12,941
And, then we want to set the map view's annotations.
并且设置 map view 的 annotations。

1771
01:14:12,943 --> 01:14:18,479
So, let's remove the existing annotations from the map view.
先删除掉现存的所有的 annotations，

1772
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:25,019
And then, let's MapView.addAnnotation for our way point.
再把 waypoint 加到 map view 里去。

1773
01:14:25,021 --> 01:14:27,688
Okay, which remember, is an MKAnnotation, so we can do that.
记住 waypoint 是 MKAnnotation 类型，所以我们可以把它作为参数。

1774
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:29,589
And then, let's also zoom in on those.
然后，我们放大它。

1775
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:34,460
So, showAnnotations, the map view's annotations and yes,
调用 showAnnotations 函数，参数为 mapView.annotations,

1776
01:14:34,462 --> 01:14:36,495
we want it to be animated.
是的，过程需要动画。

1777
01:14:36,497 --> 01:14:38,981
Okay?

1778
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:41,466
So, that's gonna update our embedded map.
这就更新了内嵌的地图。

1779
01:14:41,468 --> 01:14:44,469
Yes, Embed Map.
哦，纠正一下，“Embed Map”

1780
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:47,038
Okay.

1781
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:49,606
All right, so, now that we're actually embedding the map and
好了，我们把地图内嵌了，

1782
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:52,142
doing that actual prepare for segue,
并且为 segue 做了准备工作，

1783
01:14:52,144 --> 01:14:53,977
we should get this to work.
它应该能正常工作。

1784
01:14:53,979 --> 01:14:55,912
Here we go, and sure enough, there it is.
继续，肯定的，这就是了。

1785
01:14:55,914 --> 01:14:58,214
And, it's kind of hard to zoom out.
模拟器上的缩小操作有点麻烦。

1786
01:14:58,216 --> 01:15:02,918
Actually, I'm gonna do this on the actual device
我到真实设备上试一下，

1787
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,321
cuz it's a little easier to pinch.
因为再那上面 pinch 操作更简单。

1788
01:15:06,323 --> 01:15:16,397
>> [INAUDIBLE].

1789
01:15:18,434 --> 01:15:20,701
>> Oh, I didn't hit Play.
哦 我没有运行程序。

1790
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:29,676
There we
那么

1791
01:15:29,678 --> 01:15:34,814
go.
走起。

1792
